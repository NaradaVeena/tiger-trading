**Drawdown from ATH:** -50.8%  

---

## 1. Stage Identification

### Daily Timeframe: STAGE 4 (Decline)

**Evidence:**

- **Lower highs:** $262.90 (Sep) → $232 (Oct) → $198 (Nov) → $189 (Jan) → $192.86 (Feb 10 earnings pop) → $133.29 (Feb 13)
- **Lower lows:** $186 (late Sep) → $148 (late Oct) → $131 (mid-Nov) → $137 (early Feb) → $122.57 (Feb 13)
- **Price below ALL moving averages:**
  - SMA5: $154.03 (price $25 below)
  - SMA20: $161.97 (price $33 below)
  - SMA50: $163.06 (price $34 below)
  - SMA200: $149.32 (price $20 below)
- **Path of least resistance:** Lower
- **RSI(14):** 38.8 — trending toward oversold but not at extremes, consistent with sustained selling
- **MACD:** -5.95 with histogram at -3.50 — deeply negative and expanding, confirming accelerating downward momentum

The daily chart is textbook Stage 4: *"An environment where the path of least resistance is lower. Sellers are clearly in control, creating a condition where lower highs and lower lows prevail."*

### Weekly Timeframe: LATE STAGE 3 → EARLY STAGE 4 TRANSITION

**Evidence:**

- **Lower highs on weekly closes:** $245 (Sep 15) → $206 (Oct 6) → $186 (Oct 27) → $182 (Jan 12) → $129 (Feb 13)
- **Lower lows on weekly closes:** $197 (Sep 22) → $159 (Oct 13) → $144 (Nov 10) → $141 (Nov 17) → $150 (Jan 26) → $129 (Feb 13)
- **Weekly MA structure:**
  - 10-week SMA: $162.41
  - 20-week SMA: $165.65
  - 40-week SMA: $152.14 (STILL RISING — key detail)
  - Price ($129.32) is below ALL weekly MAs
  - 10w has crossed below 20w (bearish crossover)
- **The 40-week SMA still has a positive slope.** Per Shannon, this is the most important single MA — its direction tells you the dominant longer-term trend bias. A rising 40w means the *longest-term* players haven't fully capitulated yet. However, price is now $23 below it, and the slope is decelerating. This is the transition zone.

**Verdict:** The weekly is in the late stages of Stage 3 distribution transitioning into Stage 4 decline. The 10w/20w bearish crossover, price below all MAs, and lower highs/lower lows pattern all confirm. The still-rising 40w is the last holdout — once it flattens and rolls over, the weekly will be unambiguously Stage 4.

## 2. Moving Average Alignment & Slopes

### Daily MAs

| MA | Value | Slope | vs Price |
|----|-------|-------|----------|
| SMA5 | $154.03 | Declining sharply | Price $25 below |
| SMA20 | $161.97 | Declining | Price $33 below |
| SMA50 | $163.06 | Declining/flat | Price $34 below |
| SMA200 | $149.32 | Flattening (was rising) | Price $20 below |

**Daily MA alignment:** SMA5 < SMA200 < SMA20 ≈ SMA50 — this is disordered but critically, price is below ALL of them. The SMA5 has crashed below the SMA200 while the SMA20 and SMA50 remain clustered above — this creates a dense resistance zone between $149-$163 that will be extremely difficult for price to reclaim.

Per Shannon: *"When stock rallies to a level (represented by declining MAs) it finds renewed supply where sellers last took control."* Every one of these MAs is now overhead resistance.

### Weekly MAs

| MA | Value | Slope | vs Price |
|----|-------|-------|----------|
| 10-week | $162.41 | Decelerating | Price $33 below |
| 20-week | $165.65 | Flattening | Price $36 below |
| 40-week | $152.14 | Still rising (key!) | Price $23 below |

**Weekly MA alignment:** 10w < 20w, both above 40w, price below all three. The 10w crossing below the 20w is the first formal bearish crossover on the weekly timeframe — Shannon identifies this as *"the first sign of trend confusion among timeframe players."*

**Critical:** The 40-week SMA is still rising at $152.14. Per Shannon, *"the likelihood of a failed rally increases significantly when the longer-term moving average still exhibits a negative slope."* The 40w hasn't gone negative yet, which means we can't yet definitively say rallies will fail on the weekly timeframe. But the gap between price and the 40w ($23) is enormous, suggesting the 40w will flatten and roll over in the coming weeks.

## 3. Volume Character

### The Earnings Crash (Feb 9-13 week)

| Date | Close | Volume | Character |
|------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Feb 9 (Mon) | $187.67 | 7.4M | Pre-earnings rally |
| Feb 10 (Tue) | $182.86 | 8.4M | Earnings day, sold off from $192.86 high |
| Feb 11 (Wed) | $143.71 | **16.4M** | **GAP DOWN 21%** — climactic selling |
| Feb 12 (Thu) | $126.58 | 11.4M | Continued heavy liquidation |
| Feb 13 (Fri) | $129.32 | 7.7M | Volume declining, slight bounce |

**Weekly volume:** 51.4M shares — **the highest weekly volume in ALAB's entire trading history.** This exceeds even the prior earnings crash (Oct 13 week: 44.9M) and the Nov 2024 earnings breakout (56.8M, but that was a bullish catalyst).

**Shannon's framework on this volume:**

1. *"Large volume after extended trending often signals exhaustion and turning point"* — This is textbook. After a 5-month decline from ATH, we just saw the single largest weekly volume print. This is a potential capitulation signal.

2. *"Big volume without further downside = sign of accumulation (potential turning point)"* — We need to watch whether $122.57 holds. If the stock stabilizes here on declining volume, it would be early evidence of a turning point.

3. *"Fear-driven liquidation plays out in multiple waves — not just one sell-off"* — This is the counterargument. This is NOT the first selloff from ATH. The prior waves were Oct 13 ($154.50 low), Nov 10-17 ($131.42 low), and now Feb ($122.57 low). Each wave has made a new low. The question is whether this wave is the *final* one.

4. *"Climactic selling: high-volume event (often news-driven) shakes last stubborn longs out while shorts rush to cover"* — The Feb 11 gap down on 16.4M shares fits this description. The declining volume on Feb 12-13 (11.4M → 7.7M) is mildly encouraging — sellers are exhausting.

**Volume verdict:** The volume character is **consistent with late-stage capitulation**, but not yet confirmed as a turning point. We need to see: (a) $122.57 hold as a low, (b) declining volume on any further down days, and (c) eventually a rally on volume heavier than the recent decline volume. None of these are present yet.

## 4. Key Support & Resistance Levels

### From Volume Profile (6-month)

| Level | Type | Significance |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **$188.06** | VP VAH | Upper bound of 6-month value area — major resistance |
| **$163.06** | SMA50 cluster | Dense MA resistance zone ($149-$163) |
| **$149.32** | SMA200 | Key dynamic resistance, flattening |
| **$144.79** | VP POC | Highest-volume price node — gravitational center |
| **$138.94** | VP VAL | Lower bound of value area — BROKEN on Feb 12 |
| **$131.42** | Prior swing low | Nov 17 weekly low — broken |
| **$129.32** | Current price | — |
| **$122.57** | Recent low | Feb 13 intraday low — CRITICAL SUPPORT |

### From Volume Profile (1-year)

| Level | Type | Significance |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **$172.99** | 1Y VP VAH | — |
| **$92.08** | 1Y VP POC | Massive volume node from base-building period |
| **$100-$105** | Prior consolidation | Late 2024 / Jan-Feb 2025 accumulation zone |

### Critical Observations

1. **Price has broken below the 6-month VP VAL ($138.94).** The stock is now trading in low-volume territory — below where the majority of 6-month transactions occurred. Per Shannon's polarity principle, $138.94 now acts as resistance.

2. **The $122.57 low is the last stand before a volume vacuum.** Between $122 and $100, there is relatively little trading history. If $122.57 breaks, the next meaningful support is the $100-$105 zone (late 2024 / early 2025 consolidation area) and ultimately the 1-year VP POC at $92.08.

3. **The $149-$163 zone is a resistance fortress.** SMA200 ($149.32), SMA5 ($154.03), SMA20 ($161.97), SMA50 ($163.06), and near the VP POC ($144.79). Any rally attempt will face relentless supply through this entire zone.

## 5. Multi-Timeframe Alignment

| Dimension | Daily | Weekly | Aligned? |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|
| Stage | Stage 4 (Decline) | Late Stage 3 → Stage 4 | **YES — bearish** |
| Price vs MAs | Below ALL | Below ALL | **YES — bearish** |
| MA slope | All declining/flat | 10w/20w flattening, 40w still rising | **Mostly aligned** |
| Price pattern | Lower highs, lower lows | Lower highs, lower lows | **YES — bearish** |
| Volume | Expanding on declines | Climactic 51.4M week | **Bearish, possible exhaustion** |

**Multi-timeframe verdict:** Daily and weekly are aligned bearish. The only nuance is the still-rising 40-week SMA, which is the last vestige of the prior Stage 2 uptrend. Both timeframes confirm the path of least resistance is lower.

Per Shannon: *"The highest-probability trades come when there is alignment of trend across multiple timeframes."* Currently, that alignment favors the **short side or cash** — NOT longs.

## 6. Risk/Reward Assessment

### Hypothetical Long Trade (NOT RECOMMENDED — see below)

| Parameter | Level | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Entry | $129.32 | Current price |
| Stop | $120.00 | Below $122.57 swing low |
| Risk per share | $9.32 | |
| Target 1 | $144.79 (VP POC) | $15.47 reward → **1.7:1 R:R** |
| Target 2 | $149.32 (SMA200) | $20.00 reward → **2.1:1 R:R** |
| Target 3 | $163.06 (SMA50) | $33.74 reward → **3.6:1 R:R** |

**The math problem:** Target 1 and Target 2 do not meet the minimum 3:1 threshold. Target 3 requires the stock to rally through a massive resistance fortress — the VP POC, SMA200, SMA5, SMA20, and SMA50 are all stacked between $144 and $163. In a Stage 4 decline, per Shannon, rallies to declining MAs *"find renewed supply where sellers last took control."* The probability of reaching Target 3 in the current environment is low.

### If $122.57 Breaks

| Parameter | Level | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Next support | $100-$105 | Prior consolidation zone |
| Downside risk | $24-$29/share | -19% to -22% further decline |

---

## 7. Recommendation

### Current Assessment

| Dimension | Rating |
|-----------|--------|
| **Daily Stage** | Stage 4 — Decline |
| **Weekly Stage** | Late Stage 3 → Early Stage 4 |
| **Direction** | DOWN — sellers in control |
| **Trend strength** | Strong decline, volume confirming |
| **Trade setup** | **NO LONG TRADE** |

### Does Shannon's Framework Favor a Trade NOW?

**No. Absolutely not.**

Shannon is unequivocal on this: *"In Stage 4, trade the short side, or stay in cash. Rallies are guilty until proven innocent."*

The specific reasons:

1. **Both timeframes are bearish.** Daily is Stage 4; weekly is transitioning from Stage 3 to Stage 4. There is no timeframe to hang a bullish thesis on.

2. **Price is below all moving averages on both timeframes.** Every MA is overhead resistance. Per Shannon, *"when stock rallies to a level represented by declining MAs, it finds renewed supply."*

3. **The 5%+ gap rule applies.** The Feb 11 gap down from $182.86 to open at $160.76 was a **12% gap lower**. Shannon specifically warns: *"Consider a trend broken when it gaps lower by 5% or more."*

4. **Risk/reward fails the 3:1 test.** Realistic targets (VP POC, SMA200) offer only 1.7:1 to 2.1:1 reward/risk. The only target meeting 3:1 requires rallying through a wall of resistance — improbable in Stage 4.

5. **Broken support everywhere.** The 6-month VP VAL ($138.94), the prior swing lows ($131.42), and the SMA200 ($149.32) are all broken. Per the polarity principle, these are all resistance now.

### What WOULD Change the Picture

For ALAB to become actionable on the long side, we need to see the **full Stage 1 accumulation process**:

1. **Price stabilization** — stock stops making new lows, forms a range
2. **Declining volume** — selling exhausts, activity diminishes
3. **Higher lows begin forming** — buyers bidding more aggressively at progressively higher prices
4. **MAs begin crossing back and forth** — the transition from bearish alignment to trendless indecision
5. **40-week SMA flattens** — the long-term trend bias neutralizes
6. **Eventually:** Breakout above the accumulation range on expanding volume = Stage 2 begins

**Estimated timeline:** Given the magnitude of this decline (51% from ATH), the Stage 1 base-building process will likely take **weeks to months**, not days.

### The Capitulation Question

The one nuance worth noting: the Feb 9 week's 51.4M volume is the highest weekly volume in ALAB's history. Per Shannon, *"climactic selling: high-volume event (often news-driven) shakes last stubborn longs out."* The declining daily volume from 16.4M → 11.4M → 7.7M suggests the immediate selling wave may be exhausting.

This does NOT make it a buy. It means we should **watch this level closely** for signs of base-building. If $122.57 holds over the next 2-4 weeks with declining volume, and higher lows begin forming, ALAB may be entering Stage 1 accumulation. That is a "watch" phase, not a "buy" phase.

### Key Levels to Monitor

| Level | Significance | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **$122.57** | Recent low — line in the sand | Break below = next stop $100-$105 |
| **$138.94** | VP VAL — first resistance test | Reclaiming this on volume = early strength signal |
| **$144.79** | VP POC — gravitational center | Key level for any base formation |
| **$149.32** | SMA200 — dynamic resistance | Reclaiming this changes the character |
| **$100-$105** | Next support if $122.57 fails | Prior accumulation zone |

### Bottom Line

**ALAB is in Stage 4 decline on the daily and transitioning to Stage 4 on the weekly. Per Shannon's framework, this is a "short or cash" environment — NOT a buying opportunity. The stock has broken every meaningful support level and all moving averages are overhead resistance. The post-earnings volume climax on Feb 11-13 is a potential exhaustion signal, but exhaustion signals in Stage 4 require confirmation through base-building before they become actionable. Do not attempt to catch this falling knife. Wait for Stage 1 accumulation to form, then wait for Stage 2 breakout confirmation before establishing a long position.**

For the Tiger Portfolio: if a position exists, Shannon's framework says **reduce or exit**. If no position exists, **stay on the sidelines and watch for accumulation**. The stock needs to prove itself before capital is committed.

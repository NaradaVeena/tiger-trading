### Proformas & Trades
**No proformas pending.** No trades locked today.

### Exit Rules Check
- **ANET** -4.2% — Within tolerance (-15% limit). Thesis intact.
- **PWR, LITE, GLW, VRT:** RSI > 70 (Overbought).
  - We hold none of these. If we did, we would consider trimming.
  - **PWR** is Trending, so RSI > 70 is less bearish (momentum).
  - **LITE** data needs verification.

### Observations
1. **Regime Stagnation:** Most names stuck in Chop/Mixed. ALAB/NVT/FN all in Chop. This validates our patience.
2. **Trending Strength:** COHR and PWR are the standout leaders. PWR hitting RSI 72.7 suggests potential exhaustion, but trend is strong.
3. **ANET Pullback:** Drifted lower (-1.8%) to $137.50. RSI 50 is neutral. Volume profile support at $127.
4. **Macro Cooling:** Sentiment dropped from Risk-On to Neutral. VIX holding > 20. Caution warranted.

## Revised Portfolio — Phase 1

### TIER 1: BUY NOW (strong chart + thesis)

**1. ALAB (Astera Labs) — $25,000 (25%)**
- Price: ~$130 | Entry zone: $120-135
- Why NOW: Best risk/reward setup. RSI 39 (oversold). Thick volume support $75-150. 50% off highs — froth is gone. Growing 115% with 74% gross margins. Amazon warrant.
- Action: Buy $15,000 Tuesday at open. Add $10,000 on any dip to $120-125.
- Invalidation: Below $100 (structural break)

### TIER 2: STARTER + PATIENCE (good thesis, chart needs work)

**2. NVT (nVent Electric) — $15,000 (15%)**
- Price: ~$113 | Entry zone: $100-115
- Why: Best fundamentals (28x P/E, $2.3B backlog, NVIDIA cooling). But testing $115-121 resistance — could double top.
- Action: Starter $5,000 Tuesday. Add $5,000 only on breakout above $121 with volume. Add final $5,000 on pullback to $100 if double top plays out.
- Invalidation: Below $86 (lower support broken)

**3. FN (Fabrinet) — $12,000 (12%)**
- Price: ~$496 | Entry zone: $440-470
- Why: Sole 1.6T transceiver manufacturer, unmatched moat. But bearish RSI divergence + light volume on bounce.
- Action: Starter $4,000 Tuesday. Hold remaining $8,000 for pullback to $440-470 (volume support on VP).
- Invalidation: Below $400 (trend break)

**4. CRDO (Credo Technology) — $8,000 (8%)**
- Price: ~$121 | Entry zone: $100-125
- Why: 88% AEC market share, 173% growth, sitting on 200d SMA.
- Action: Starter $3,000 if $122 holds Tuesday. Add on confirmation above $130. If $122 breaks, wait for $100-105.
- Invalidation: Below $95

### TIER 3: WATCH ONLY (wait for chart to come to us)

**5. COHR (Coherent) — $10,000 reserved**
- Price: ~$217 | Target entry: $150-200
- Why wait: Thin volume structure above $121. Air pocket below $199. MACD rolling over.
- Trigger: Buy starter at $200. Load at $150-160.

**6. PWR (Quanta Services) — $7,000 reserved**
- Price: ~$524 | Target entry: $430-470
- Why wait: Upper channel resistance, 76x trailing P/E, near ATH.
- Trigger: Buy on post-earnings pullback to midline ($467) or lower channel ($422).

### TIER 4: LEAPS (only on oversold names — never on extended charts)

**7. ALAB Jan 2028 LEAPS — $5,000**
- Highest conviction name, leverage the oversold setup
- Target: delta ~0.50 call, strike near $140-150
- LEAPS on oversold = smart leverage. LEAPS on extended = paying theta to lose.

~~NVT/FN LEAPS~~ — REMOVED. Don't buy leveraged time decay on charts that say "wait."

### CASH RESERVE: $15,000 (15%)
- Deploy on 10%+ pullbacks in core names
- Or opportunistic new positions
- Cash IS the hedge until 70%+ deployed

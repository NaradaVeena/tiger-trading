# PWR (Quanta Services) — Brian Shannon Multiple Timeframe Stage Analysis

**Date:** February 16, 2026  
**Price:** $524.08  
**Analyst:** Narada (Shannon MTF Framework)

## Executive Summary

PWR is in **Stage 2 Markup on both weekly and daily timeframes**, with textbook MA alignment and a fresh breakout from a multi-month consolidation. However, the stock is **significantly extended from all moving averages**, making new entries here high-risk despite the bullish structure. Shannon's rule applies: *"The further a stock travels from a valid level of support, the riskier purchases are regardless of trend maturity."* Wait for a pullback to establish a position with favorable risk/reward.

## 1. Stage Identification

### Weekly Timeframe: **Stage 2 Markup (Mature)**

- **Price pattern:** Higher highs and higher lows over the past 12 months. From ~$260 (Feb 2025) to $524 (Feb 2026) — an 83% advance.
- **MA alignment:** SMA5 ($488) > SMA20 ($450) > SMA50 ($386) — **perfect Stage 2 stack**, all rising.
- **Long-term MA slope:** SMA50 rising steadily — longer-term players are confident and adding.
- **RSI:** 74.1 — pushing into overbought territory on the weekly. This level has historically preceded pullbacks or consolidations in PWR.
- **MACD:** 31.6 with positive histogram (3.5), bullish but at elevated levels.

The weekly is unambiguously Stage 2. The uptrend from the $227-261 base has been orderly with corrections resolving higher. The Oct-Jan consolidation (~$410-475) was a healthy time correction within the weekly uptrend — a "broken stairstep" that has now resolved higher, as Shannon's framework predicts for corrections within a primary trend.

### Daily Timeframe: **Stage 2 Markup (Early Re-emergence)**

- **Price pattern:** After a ~4 month Stage 1/consolidation (mid-Oct through late-Jan, range ~$410-$475), PWR has broken out decisively above the consolidation highs. The breakout occurred on strong volume in late January/early February, pushing to new all-time highs at $543.28 before settling at $524.
- **MA alignment:** SMA5 ($518) > SMA20 ($487) > SMA50 ($458) — **perfect Stage 2 alignment**, all with positive slope.
- **Long-term MA slope:** SMA200 (estimated ~$420-430 from chart) rising — the dominant trend is up.
- **RSI:** 67.5 — strong but not yet overbought on the daily.
- **MACD:** 18.6 with positive histogram (3.8), bullish crossover intact, momentum expanding.

The daily shows a **renewed trending campaign** — the stock has emerged from a multi-month consolidation back into Stage 2 markup. This is the classic pattern Shannon describes: "consolidations holding above rising longer-term MA often lead to significant upside moves once buyers regain control of the short-term trend."

## 2. Moving Average Alignment & Slopes

| Timeframe | SMA5 | SMA20 | SMA50 | Alignment | All Rising? |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Daily | $517.82 | $486.81 | $458.14 | ✅ Short > Int > Long | ✅ Yes |
| Weekly | $488.47 | $449.73 | $385.67 | ✅ Short > Int > Long | ✅ Yes |

**Assessment:** Textbook Stage 2 MA structure on both timeframes. No crossovers, no indecision. The slope of all MAs is positive, confirming buyers are in control across all timeframe participants.

**Key concern — Extension from MAs:**
- Daily: Price is **$37 above SMA20 (7.7%)** and **$66 above SMA50 (14.4%)**
- Weekly: Price is **$74 above SMA20 (16.5%)** and **$138 above SMA50 (35.9%)**

This degree of extension is a flashing yellow light. Per Shannon: purchases made far from a valid level of support carry elevated risk regardless of trend maturity. The MAs are dynamic support — and they're far below.

## 3. Volume Character

### Daily Volume Analysis:
- **Breakout volume (late Jan/early Feb):** Clearly elevated — the large green candles pushing through $475-$520+ were accompanied by above-average volume. This is healthy Stage 2 behavior: "increasing volume as stock rises."
- **The Oct-Jan consolidation:** Volume was generally lighter and mixed — consistent with a time correction (diminished activity during consolidation).
- **Recent action:** The most recent candles near $524 show moderately strong volume, but the initial breakout surge volume was the heaviest.

**Shannon interpretation:** Volume confirmed the breakout. The surge from consolidation into new highs on expanding volume is classic Stage 2 re-emergence — buyers from multiple timeframes scrambling to establish positions, short sellers covering, sidelined cash attracted to momentum.

**Caution:** Shannon notes that "heaviest volume tends to be found near the end of a short-term thrust higher." If volume is already declining from the breakout peak while price remains elevated, watch for signs the short-term thrust is maturing.

### Weekly Volume Analysis:
- The recent weeks show green (up) volume bars that are above-average, confirming weekly buyers are active.
- No signs of churning (heavy volume without progress) — the volume is producing upside, which is healthy.

## 4. Key Support & Resistance Levels

### From Volume Profile (Daily, 6-month):
| Level | Price | Significance |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **VP POC** | $436.62 | Point of Control — highest-volume node over 6 months. Major support. |
| **VP VAH** | $483.19 | Value Area High — upper boundary of main value area. First meaningful support on pullback. Breakout level. |
| **VP VAL** | $411.08 | Value Area Low — lower boundary. Deep support; break below here would be Stage 3 concern. |

### From Volume Profile (Weekly, 1-year):
| Level | Price | Significance |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **VP POC** | $261.34 | Base of the entire yearly move — irrelevant for near-term. |
| **VP VAH** | $422.07 | Yearly value area high — deep support on weekly timeframe. |

### Key Structural Levels:
| Level | Price | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| **ATH** | ~$543 | Resistance — recent high. |
| **Breakout zone** | $475-$483 | Prior consolidation highs → now resistance-turned-support (Polarity Principle). First pullback to this zone should find buyers. |
| **Rising SMA50 (daily)** | $458 | Dynamic support — rising. Deeper pullback level. |
| **Consolidation low** | ~$410 | Major support — break below invalidates the Stage 2 thesis. |
| **SMA200 (daily)** | ~$425-435 | Long-term dynamic support. |

**The $475-$483 zone is the critical level.** Per the Polarity Principle, this former resistance (consolidation highs and VP VAH) should now act as support. Shannon: "On the first correction after breakout, the prior resistance level commonly finds buyers waiting."

## 5. Multi-Timeframe Alignment

| Factor | Daily | Weekly | Aligned? |
|--------|-------|--------|----------|
| Stage | 2 (Early re-emergence) | 2 (Mature) | ✅ Yes |
| MA Stack | Short > Int > Long | Short > Int > Long | ✅ Yes |
| MA Slopes | All rising | All rising | ✅ Yes |
| Price vs MAs | Above all | Above all | ✅ Yes |
| RSI | 67.5 (healthy) | 74.1 (overbought) | ⚠️ Weekly hot |
| MACD | Positive, expanding | Positive, expanding | ✅ Yes |
| Volume | Confirmed breakout | Confirmed uptrend | ✅ Yes |

**Assessment:** Strong multi-timeframe alignment. Both timeframes confirm Stage 2 with proper MA alignment. Shannon's highest-probability setup: "The highest-probability trades come when there is alignment of trend across multiple timeframes."

**The sole concern is the weekly RSI at 74.1** — this is overbought and historically precedes at least a pause or pullback. Combined with the extreme extension from MAs, this suggests the stock needs to consolidate or pull back before offering a favorable entry.

## 6. Risk/Reward Assessment

### Scenario A: Enter Now at $524

- **Stop:** Below most recent higher low or the breakout zone (~$475). Stop at $472.
  - Risk per share: $524 - $472 = **$52 (9.9%)**
- **Target:** No overhead resistance (ATH territory). Measured move from consolidation breakout: range was ~$410-$475 = $65. Add to breakout point: $475 + $65 = **$540**. Already nearly there.
  - Extended target using weekly trend: $575-$600 possible.
  - Reward at $575: $575 - $524 = **$51 (9.7%)**
- **Risk:Reward = 1:1** ❌ Does NOT meet Shannon's 3:1 minimum.

### Scenario B: Enter on Pullback to $483-$490 (former resistance / VP VAH)

- **Stop:** Below $465 (below SMA50 and below the consolidation zone).
  - Risk per share: $485 - $465 = **$20 (4.1%)**
- **Target:** $543 (recent ATH retest), then $575+ (extension).
  - Reward at $543: $543 - $485 = **$58 (12.0%)**
  - Reward at $575: $575 - $485 = **$90 (18.6%)**
- **Risk:Reward = 2.9:1 to 4.5:1** ✅ Meets Shannon's 3:1 threshold.

### Scenario C: Enter on Deeper Pullback to $458-$465 (SMA50 / POC area)

- **Stop:** Below $435 (SMA200 / VP POC).
  - Risk per share: $460 - $435 = **$25 (5.4%)**
- **Target:** $543+ (ATH retest).
  - Reward at $543: $543 - $460 = **$83 (18.0%)**
- **Risk:Reward = 3.3:1** ✅ Excellent.

## 7. Recommendation

### Stage: **Stage 2 Markup** (both timeframes)
### Direction: **Bullish** — path of least resistance is higher
### Trend: **Strong and confirmed** — multi-timeframe alignment intact

### Does This Favor a Trade NOW? **No.**

Despite the textbook Stage 2 structure and multi-timeframe alignment, **current conditions do not favor a new entry at $524**:

1. **Extension risk is high.** Price is 7.7% above the daily SMA20 and 14.4% above the daily SMA50. Shannon explicitly warns against chasing extended moves: *"The further a stock has traveled from a level of support, the riskier purchases are regardless of trend maturity."*

2. **Risk/reward fails at current price.** Entering at $524 with a stop at $472 yields roughly 1:1 R:R — well below the required 3:1 minimum. There is no logical tighter stop because there's no nearby support structure at these extended levels.

3. **Weekly RSI at 74.1** suggests the short-term thrust is mature. Shannon: *"Greed-driven fast rallies should alert you to monitor short-term charts closely — these stocks can decline faster than they rallied."*

4. **Late-stage breakout euphoria.** The move from $410 to $543 (32% in ~3 months) has the character of a rapid Stage 2 advance that typically precedes a needed correction. Shannon: *"Some of the strongest trending moves develop near the tail end of a trend — a stock trading higher for a long period takes on perception of being bulletproof."*

5. **76x P/E** — while Shannon explicitly says not to let fundamentals override price action in a strong trend, extreme valuation increases the downside risk if the trend weakens. This is not a reason to avoid the stock, but it is context for the velocity of any potential decline.

### Action Plan:

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **PWR pulls back to $483-$490** | Watch for a higher low to form. Enter on the first higher high on the short-term timeframe (Shannon's entry rule). Stop below $465. Target $543, then $575+. |
| **PWR pulls back to $458-$465** | More aggressive accumulation opportunity. Enter on signs of buying support near rising SMA50. Stop below $435. Target $543+. |
| **PWR breaks below $410** | Stage 2 thesis is invalid. The Oct-Jan consolidation was distribution (Stage 3), not accumulation. Stand aside. |
| **PWR continues higher without pullback** | Do not chase. The absence of a pullback does not create an obligation to buy. The next correction within the trend will come — be patient and wait for it. Per Shannon: corrections are "bullish, normal, and necessary for long-term trends to continue." |

### Summary Statement:

**PWR is in a strong Stage 2 uptrend on both daily and weekly timeframes with textbook MA alignment and volume confirmation. The breakout from the October-January consolidation is legitimate and structurally bullish. However, the stock is dangerously extended from all moving averages, the weekly RSI is overbought, and risk/reward at current price is approximately 1:1 — far below the required 3:1 minimum. The correct Shannon play is to wait for the inevitable pullback toward the $483-490 breakout zone (former resistance, now support via the Polarity Principle), confirm a higher low, and enter on the first higher high. The trend is your friend, but only at the right price.**

## 1.3 AI Thesis

nVent is building a formidable position in AI data center infrastructure through multiple vectors:

1. **NVIDIA Liquid Cooling Partnership:** Announced collaboration to deploy liquid cooling at scale for NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 and next-gen platforms. This is a flagship partnership — NVIDIA chose nVent as a preferred cooling partner.

2. **Liquid Cooling Penetration:** Management notes less than 30% of data centers have liquid cooling today, with significant growth expected due to rising heat loads from AI GPUs. nVent has been doing liquid cooling "for well over a decade" and is multiple generations deep.

3. **New Capacity:** Opened a new liquid cooling facility in Blaine, Minnesota (January 2026), with production already ramping.

4. **Full Infrastructure Stack:** Beyond cooling, nVent provides server racks, enclosures, cable management, and power distribution — a comprehensive data center solution.

5. **Data Center Revenue Trajectory:** $600M (FY2024) → $1.0B (FY2025) → projected well above $1B in FY2026. Infrastructure now represents 45% of sales, expected to be >50% in FY2026.

6. **86 new products launched** in FY2025, contributing ~10 points to sales growth. New product vitality at 27%.

## 1.4 Competitive Position

**Competitors:** Vertiv (VRT), Hubbell (HUBB), Eaton (ETN), Schneider Electric, CoolIT Systems

**Moat Assessment:**
- ✅ **NVIDIA partnership depth** — one of the deepest among diversified infrastructure players
- ✅ **Highest data center concentration** (~30% DC exposure) among diversified electrical companies
- ✅ **Decades of thermal expertise** with multiple generations of liquid cooling technology
- ✅ **Comprehensive solution set** — racks, enclosures, cooling, cable management, power in one vendor
- ✅ **Strong backlog** at $2.3B provides exceptional visibility
- ⚠️ Not a pure-play — still has industrial/commercial exposure (55% of sales)

**vs. Vertiv:** Vertiv is larger and more pure-play data center, but nVent has stronger organic growth and better valuation metrics. nVent also provides a broader infrastructure solution beyond just cooling.

## 1.5 Recent Catalysts

- ✅ **Q4 2025 beat:** Revenue and EPS exceeded guidance; record quarterly sales >$1B for second consecutive quarter
- ✅ **Record backlog:** $2.3B, tripled YoY, with most converting through FY2026
- ✅ **Blaine, MN facility:** New liquid cooling plant opened January 2026, already ramping
- ✅ **Strong FY2026 guidance:** 15-18% reported growth, 20-24% EPS growth
- ✅ **Organic orders +30%** driven by AI data center buildout; non-DC orders also growing low double digits
- ⚠️ **CEO selling shares:** Beth Wozniak sold 7,597 shares on Feb 11 at $116.47 (relatively small)
- ✅ **Multiple analyst upgrades:** Barclays ($141), RBC ($138), KeyCorp ($130) — consensus ~$125

## 1.6 Risks

1. **Tariff exposure:** ~$80M incremental tariffs expected in FY2026 (manageable but a headwind)
2. **Margin compression:** Q4 margins slightly below expectations due to mix, inflation, and investment spending
3. **Customer concentration risk:** Heavy reliance on hyperscaler data center buildouts
4. **Lumpy orders:** Data center orders can be "very lumpy" — quarter-to-quarter volatility
5. **Execution risk on new capacity:** Liquid cooling ramp must execute flawlessly to meet demand
6. **Valuation at historical highs:** P/E of ~31x and P/S of ~5.2x are elevated for an industrial company
7. **Competition intensifying:** Eaton's $9.5B Boyd acquisition shows large competitors entering aggressively

## 1.7 Technical Setup

| Indicator | Value | Signal |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Price** | $112.65 | |
| **SMA20** | $113.26 | Price just below — neutral |
| **EMA9** | $113.14 | Price just below — slight caution |
| **EMA21** | $112.21 | Price at EMA21 — support |
| **RSI(14)** | 52.2 | Neutral — neither overbought nor oversold |
| **MACD** | 1.44 / Signal 1.98 | Slight bearish crossover, histogram negative |
| **6-Mo Range** | $85.72 - $120.85 | Price in upper half of range |

**Assessment:** Consolidating after post-earnings move higher. Price sitting right at moving average cluster ($112-$113). RSI neutral at 52. Support at $108-110, resistance at $120. Bullish longer-term trend from August lows, but short-term needs to hold the $110 area.

## 1.8 Verdict

### Bull Case 🐂
- AI data center cooling is a **secular megatrend** with less than 30% penetration today
- NVIDIA partnership provides a moat that smaller competitors can't replicate
- $2.3B backlog = exceptional visibility for FY2026 and beyond
- Management executing well: record revenue, EPS, and FCF all growing 30%+
- Reasonable valuation (~28x forward P/E) for a company with 20%+ EPS growth
- Infrastructure mix shift from 12% → 45% → 50%+ creates a higher-quality revenue profile

### Bear Case 🐻
- Insider selling (CEO) at these levels raises minor concern
- P/E of 31x is rich for what's still partly an industrial conglomerate
- Tariffs ($80M) and margin pressures could limit profitability gains
- Competition from larger players (Eaton, Vertiv, Schneider) intensifying
- AI capex cycle could slow if hyperscaler spending moderates

### Overall Score: **8/10** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Upgraded from prior 7/10 hidden gem score.** The Q4 results and $2.3B backlog confirm nVent is executing on its AI infrastructure thesis. The NVIDIA partnership, expanding liquid cooling capacity, and strong organic growth trajectory make this one of the best risk-reward plays in AI infrastructure. Not a moonshot — it's a well-run company catching a massive tailwind.

- Non-GAAP gross margin: ~74%
- Non-GAAP operating expenses: $112M - $118M
- EPS guidance: $0.53-$0.54

## 2.3 AI Thesis

Astera Labs sits at the nexus of AI's next constraint — **connectivity**:

1. **Scorpio Fabric Switch:** The Scorpio X-Series smart fabric switch enables massive GPU-to-GPU communication in AI clusters. Accounted for a growing share of revenue — Scorpio + Taurus (Ethernet cables) were 30% of Q4 revenue collectively. The Scorpio X-Series roadmap is being broadened to address expanding scale-up market opportunities.

2. **PCIe/CXL Retimers:** Core product enabling high-speed data paths between CPUs, GPUs, and memory. Essential for CXL memory pooling and disaggregation — a key technology for next-gen AI architectures.

3. **Taurus Ethernet Cables:** Smart cable solutions for scale-out networking in AI clusters. Growing rapidly alongside Scorpio.

4. **Customer Base:** Nvidia, AMD, Intel, and Amazon are all customers. New **Amazon warrant** for ~$466M in stock signals deepening relationship.

5. **"Connectivity is the bottleneck"** — CEO Jitendra Mohan's thesis that as AI compute scales, the bandwidth and latency of interconnects become the limiting factor. This gives Astera Labs a massive secular tailwind.

6. **Full-year revenue growth of 115% YoY** demonstrates the company is capturing a real and growing market.

## 2.4 Competitive Position

**Competitors:** Broadcom (AVGO), Marvell (MRVL), Microchip (MCHP), Rambus (RMBS)

**Moat Assessment:**

- ⚠️ **CFO departure:** Mike Tate stepping down, replaced by Rambus CFO Desmond Lynch
- ⚠️ **Analyst target average ~$204-210** — stock currently well below at $132

## 2.6 Risks

1. **Extreme valuation:** P/S of ~26x even after selloff; P/E of 60-70x leaves no room for error
2. **Customer concentration:** Heavily dependent on hyperscaler spending (NVIDIA, Amazon, cloud giants)
3. **Revenue miss sensitivity:** Despite beating consensus, the stock dropped 20% because some analysts wanted >$280M — shows how unforgiving the valuation is
4. **CFO transition:** Finance chief departing adds execution uncertainty
5. **Broadcom/Marvell competition:** These are massive competitors with custom silicon capabilities and deeper customer relationships
6. **AI capex cyclicality:** If hyperscaler spending slows, Astera's growth collapses fast
7. **Share dilution:** Amazon warrant represents significant potential dilution
8. **Stock down ~50% from highs** — momentum is strongly negative

## 2.7 Technical Setup

| Indicator | Value | Signal |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Price** | $132.32 | Near 6-month lows |
| **SMA20** | $162.12 | Price well below — bearish |
| **EMA9** | $151.05 | Price well below — bearish |
| **EMA21** | $158.22 | Price well below — bearish |
| **VWAP** | $177.00 | Price 25% below VWAP — deeply oversold vs. average |
| **RSI(14)** | 40.1 | Approaching oversold territory |
| **MACD** | -5.71 / Signal -2.41 | Bearish, histogram negative |
| **6-Mo Range** | $122.57 - $262.90 | Near bottom of range |

**Assessment:** Ugly chart. The stock has been in a severe downtrend, falling from ~$263 to $132 (50% decline). RSI at 40 approaching oversold but not yet at extremes. Price well below all moving averages. Critical support at $122-125 (6-month low). Need to see stabilization and reclaim of $150+ before any technical buy signal. This is a falling knife situation.

## 2.8 Verdict

### Bull Case 🐂
- **Revenue growing 115% YoY** with Q1 guide massively above consensus — fundamental momentum is real
- Connectivity is legitimately becoming the AI bottleneck — massive addressable market
- 74% gross margins indicate genuine differentiation — this isn't a commodity chip
- Amazon warrant signals strategic importance to a top-3 hyperscaler
- Stock has fallen 50% from highs — valuation is much more reasonable than 6 months ago
- Analyst consensus target ~$204-210 implies 55%+ upside from current levels
- Scorpio fabric switch product cycle just beginning — could be a massive growth driver

### Bear Case 🐻
- Still trading at 26x sales despite 50% decline — "cheap" is relative
- CFO departure during critical growth phase raises governance questions
- Revenue miss sensitivity is extreme — stock punished despite beating consensus
- Broadcom and Marvell are formidable competitors with custom silicon advantages
- AI capex cycle risk — one bad hyperscaler quarter and this stock gets crushed
- Technical setup is terrible — momentum is strongly negative

### Overall Score: **7/10** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Upgraded from prior 6/10 hidden gem score.** The fundamental story is exceptional — 115% revenue growth, 74% gross margins, Amazon partnership deepening, and a legitimate thesis around connectivity being the next AI bottleneck. But the valuation and technical picture demand caution. This is a stock to accumulate on weakness rather than chase. At $130, you're getting a much better entry than at $260, but the volatility will be stomach-churning. Best suited for investors with a 2-3 year horizon and conviction in the AI infrastructure thesis.

# 3. COHR — Coherent Corp

## 6-Month Chart
![COHR 6-Month Daily Chart](../charts/COHR_1d_6mo_1771010111592.png)

## 3.1 Company Overview

Coherent Corp is a vertically integrated photonics and optical technology company formed through the merger of II-VI Incorporated and the original Coherent. The company designs and manufactures **optical transceivers, lasers, indium phosphide components, silicon carbide, and optical circuit switches** for data center, telecom, industrial, and automotive markets.

**Why it matters for AI:** Coherent provides the **optical plumbing** of AI data centers. As GPU clusters scale, they need ever-faster optical interconnects (800G → 1.6T → 3.2T) to move data between racks and across the network. Coherent makes the transceivers, lasers, and increasingly the optical circuit switches that make this possible.

## 3.2 Financial Snapshot (Q2 FY2026, ended Dec 2025)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Q2 Revenue** | $1.69B (+17% YoY, +7% QoQ) |
| **Data Center & Comms Revenue** | $1.2B (+33.6% YoY) |
| **Industrial Revenue** | $478M (-9.9% YoY) |
| **Non-GAAP Operating Income** | $336M (+26.8% YoY) |
| **Non-GAAP Operating Margin** | 19.9% (+147bps YoY) |
| **Non-GAAP Net Income** | $248M (+34.3% YoY) |

| **GAAP Net Income** | $146.7M |
| **Book-to-Bill (Data Center)** | >4x |
| **Market Cap** | ~$34B |
| **P/E (fwd)** | ~45x |
| **P/S (annualized)** | ~5x |

**Q3 FY2026 Guidance:**
- Revenue: **$1.70B - $1.84B** (continuing sequential growth)
- Implies FY2026 annualized revenue could reach ~$7B+

## 3.3 AI Thesis

Coherent is positioned at the heart of AI's optical infrastructure:

1. **800G/1.6T Transceivers:** The primary growth driver. 800G is now the mainstream data center standard, with 1.6T ramping across multiple customers. Coherent is the leading provider of optical transceivers for hyperscale data centers. 1.6T module gross margins expected to be **higher** than 800G given higher ASPs.

2. **Indium Phosphide Vertical Integration:** Coherent is the only major transceiver vendor that is vertically integrated in InP lasers (EMLs, CW lasers, photodiodes). The 6-inch InP capacity ramp is already at ~80% of target wafer-start rate, with yields on 6-inch **exceeding** legacy 3-inch lines. This provides a structural cost advantage.

3. **Optical Circuit Switching (OCS):** One of the highest-growth areas. Engaged with 10+ customers, backlog growing, revenue ramping through calendar 2026 and into 2027. OCS enables dynamic optical reconfiguration in AI data centers — a game-changing technology.

4. **Co-Packaged Optics (CPO):** Landmark CPO purchase order received with initial revenue expected later in FY2026. CPO is the future of optical interconnects — integrating optics directly with switch ASICs.

5. **Extraordinary Visibility:** Most of calendar 2026 already booked, calendar 2027 filling fast. Long-term supply agreements with hyperscalers. Forecasts from key customers extend to calendar 2028. 4x book-to-bill ratio in data center segment.

6. **Texas InP Facility:** Received $14.1M semiconductor grant from Texas to support indium phosphide wafer manufacturing expansion.

## 3.4 Competitive Position

**Competitors:** Lumentum (LITE), Broadcom (AVGO), Cisco/Acacia, Intel Silicon Photonics

**Moat Assessment:**
- ✅ **Vertical integration in InP** — structural cost advantage that competitors cannot easily replicate
- ✅ **6-inch InP manufacturing** — yields exceeding 3-inch provides cost leadership
- ✅ **Broadest product portfolio** — transceivers, lasers, OCS, CPO, silicon photonics all under one roof
- ✅ **4x book-to-bill** — demand far outstrips supply, giving pricing power
- ✅ **10+ OCS customers** — leading position in a nascent but massive market
- ✅ **Long-term supply agreements** with hyperscalers ensure revenue visibility
- ⚠️ **Revenue growth lags Lumentum** in some metrics (per Seeking Alpha analysis)
- ⚠️ **Non-DC business declining** — Industrial segment down 9.9% YoY is a drag

## 3.5 Recent Catalysts

- ✅ **Q2 FY2026 beat:** Revenue $1.69B vs $1.64B consensus; EPS $1.29 beat expectations
- ✅ **Strong Q3 guide:** $1.70B-$1.84B implies continued acceleration
- ✅ **4x book-to-bill ratio** in data center segment — extraordinary demand signal
- ✅ **6-inch InP ramp ahead of plan** — yields exceeding 3-inch legacy lines
- ✅ **CPO purchase order** — first major CPO revenue expected in FY2026
- ✅ **Texas semiconductor grant** ($14.1M) for InP expansion
- ✅ **Multiple analyst upgrades:** JPMorgan ($245), Stifel ($235), BofA ($250). 75% of analysts rate Buy
- ⚠️ **Post-earnings volatility:** Stock initially dropped 20% before bouncing 9%+ on Feb 7
- ⚠️ **Seeking Alpha caution:** "Must deliver big optical wins soon" — execution pressure is high

## 3.6 Risks

1. **Rich valuation:** 45x forward P/E for a company with significant non-AI business segments
2. **Industrial weakness:** -9.9% YoY in Industrial segment creates a drag on overall growth
3. **Supply/demand rebalancing:** If InP capacity catches up to demand, pricing power erodes
4. **Lumentum competition:** Lumentum showing stronger revenue growth and margin expansion in some areas
5. **Customer concentration:** Hyperscaler dependence means one customer pullback = significant impact
6. **Execution risk on capacity:** Must double InP capacity by Q4 CY2026 while maintaining yields
7. **AI capex cyclicality:** Optical transceiver demand is directly tied to hyperscaler spending
8. **Stock up ~160% from 6-month lows** — significant move already priced in

## 3.7 Technical Setup

| Indicator | Value | Signal |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| **Price** | $219.66 | |
| **SMA20** | $213.82 | Price above — bullish |
| **EMA9** | $221.03 | Price just below — slight caution |
| **EMA21** | $213.46 | Price above — bullish |
| **VWAP** | $151.47 | Price well above 6-mo VWAP — strong uptrend |
| **RSI(14)** | 54.9 | Neutral — plenty of room to run |
| **MACD** | 9.21 / Signal 9.94 | Minor bearish crossover, watching |
| **6-Mo Range** | $84.35 - $247.15 | Upper half of range |

**Assessment:** Strong uptrend from August lows (~$84) to current ~$220, representing a 160%+ move. Post-earnings volatility caused a sharp dip then recovery. Now consolidating around $220 with support at $210-213 (SMA20/EMA21 cluster) and resistance at $245-250. RSI at 55 is neutral, meaning no overbought concerns. The trend is firmly bullish but the easy money has been made.

## 3.8 Verdict

### Bull Case 🐂
- **4x book-to-bill** is one of the strongest demand signals in all of tech
- 800G → 1.6T → 3.2T transceiver upgrade cycle provides multi-year growth visibility
- **Vertical integration in InP** gives structural cost advantage that compounds over time
- OCS and CPO represent massive new revenue streams barely contributing today
- Calendar 2026 already booked, calendar 2027 filling — rare multi-year demand visibility
- Management executing well — beat on revenue, earnings, and raised guidance
- Analyst consensus strongly bullish: JPMorgan $245, BofA $250, Stifel $235

### Bear Case 🐻
- At 45x forward P/E, a LOT of growth is already priced in
- Industrial segment declining — not a pure AI play
- Stock already up 160% from 6-month lows — how much upside is left?
- Lumentum and Broadcom are strong competitors in optical transceivers
- Post-earnings 20% drop shows market sensitivity to any disappointment
- If AI capex cycle peaks in 2026-2027, the multiple compression would be severe
- Simply Wall St estimates suggest stock may be 44% overvalued

### Overall Score: **7.5/10** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐½

**Upgraded from prior 6/10 hidden gem score.** Coherent has the best demand visibility of any company in this report (4x book-to-bill, calendar 2026 booked, 2027 filling). The vertical integration moat in InP is real and getting stronger. OCS and CPO represent potentially transformative growth vectors. The risk is pure valuation — at 45x forward P/E and after a 160% run, the market has already recognized much of the story. Best approach is to buy on pullbacks (the $200 area offered a recent opportunity) and size position appropriately for the volatility.

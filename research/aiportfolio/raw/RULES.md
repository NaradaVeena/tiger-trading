# 🐯 Tiger Portfolio — Trading Rules & Process

## Core Philosophy
- **Tiger cub approach**: Concentrated, high-conviction, patient
- **Hardware moats only**: Physical assets that take years to replicate
- **Don't be whale exit liquidity**: Buy into volume nodes, not thin air
- **Cash is a position**: No rush to deploy. Cash IS the hedge until 70%+ invested.

## Position Sizing Rules
1. **Max single position**: 25% of portfolio
2. **Core positions**: 15-25% each (highest conviction, best chart setup)
3. **Starter positions**: 3-5% (thesis is strong but chart needs work)
4. **Watch list**: $0 allocated until chart confirms entry
5. **Scale in, don't lump**: Never deploy full position size at once. 50% initial, add on confirmation.

## Entry Rules
1. **Volume profile check**: Only buy into thick volume nodes. If the VP shows thin air below current price, you're liquidity for someone else's exit.
2. **RSI filter**: Prefer entries with RSI < 50. Never chase RSI > 70 unless breakout on massive volume.
3. **No buying at channel tops**: If price is at upper channel/trendline resistance, wait for pullback.
4. **Breakout confirmation**: For resistance tests (e.g., NVT $121), don't front-run. Wait for break + retest + hold on volume.
5. **Post-earnings washout = opportunity**: Beat + sell = sentiment reset, not fundamental problem. Best entries come 2-5 days after earnings overreaction.
6. **Divergence = caution**: Bearish RSI divergence (higher price, lower RSI) means reduce size. Don't ignore the signal.

## LEAPS Rules
1. **Only on oversold names**: LEAPS on extended charts = paying theta to lose
2. **Delta > 0.40**: No far OTM lottery tickets
3. **Minimum 18 months to expiry**: Time is the asset
4. **Max 10% of portfolio in LEAPS**: Leverage is a tool, not a strategy

## Exit Rules
1. **Thesis invalidation = exit**: If the reason you bought breaks, sell. No hoping.
2. **Stop-loss by thesis, not price**: Each position has a specific invalidation trigger documented in the thesis tracker.
3. **Trim on extension**: If a position runs 50%+ and RSI > 70, trim 20-30% to lock gains.
4. **Let winners run**: Don't sell just because it's green. Winners get bigger.
5. **Cut losers fast**: If a position is down 15%+ and thesis is weakening, cut it. Don't average down into a broken thesis.

## Hedge Rules
1. **No hedges while cash > 30%**: Cash IS the hedge. Don't pay theta on SPY puts while sitting on $70K cash.
2. **Deploy hedges at 70%+ invested**: Index puts or short book plays when most capital is deployed.
3. **Short book = directional puts**: No short selling stocks. Buy puts on AI disruption losers.

## Daily Workflow

### 11 AM EST — Proforma Review

5. Post proformas to Horsey group + update dashboard
6. **Wait for feedback before 2 PM lock**

### 2 PM EST — Trade Lock
1. Review any feedback on proformas
2. Lock approved trades at prevailing prices (buy at ask, sell at bid)

## Anti-Sycophancy Rules
1. **Don't validate every trade**: Just give data.
2. **If the chart says wait, say wait**: Don't find reasons to buy because the fundamentals are exciting.
3. **Acknowledge mistakes**: Wrong calls get documented, not buried.
4. **No fortune cookie wisdom**: Data and levels, not platitudes.

## Lessons Learned
*(Updated as we trade)*

1. **2026-02-13**: Don't do math in prose. Let the database handle arithmetic.
2. **2026-02-13**: LEAPS on extended charts is worse than stock — paying premium for time decay while waiting for a pullback you could just buy.
3. **2026-02-13**: Volume profile is the single best tool for avoiding whale traps. If VP is thin, you're the liquidity.

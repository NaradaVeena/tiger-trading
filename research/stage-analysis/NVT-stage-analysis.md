# NVT (nVent Electric) — Multiple Timeframe Stage Analysis

**Date:** February 16, 2026
**Price:** $113.25
**Methodology:** Brian Shannon's Multiple Timeframe Stage Analysis

---

## Executive Summary

NVT is in a **Stage 2 Markup on the weekly timeframe** but showing **early Stage 3 Distribution warning signs on the daily**. The stock rallied to $120.85 (52-week high) in early February and is now churning in the $110-118 zone on elevated volume — the hallmark of distribution. The weekly trend remains the dominant force (all MAs rising, aligned bullishly), but the daily is flashing caution signals that demand respect. **Risk/reward does NOT favor a new entry at current levels.** Wait for either a pullback to the SMA50 (~$108) or a confirmed breakout above $121 on volume.

## 1. Stage Identification

### Weekly Timeframe: STAGE 2 MARKUP ✅

**Price Pattern:** Higher highs and higher lows since the April 2025 low (~$42). The staircase pattern is intact: $42 → $70 → $56 → $90 → $80 → $117 → $93 → $121. Each successive low is higher than the prior low.

**Moving Average Alignment:**
- 10-week SMA: $108.06 — rising
- 20-week SMA: $106.17 — rising
- 40-week SMA: $93.41 — rising

**Price ($113.25) > 10w SMA ($108) > 20w SMA ($106) > 40w SMA ($93)** — textbook Stage 2 alignment. All MAs have positive slope. The 40-week (equivalent to ~200-day) is rising decisively, confirming longer-term players are confident.

**Weekly RSI:** 65.8 — bullish but not overextended. Consistent with mid-Stage 2.

**Weekly MACD:** 7.496 (above signal at 8.224, histogram -0.728) — MACD remains well above zero but the histogram has turned slightly negative, suggesting the pace of the weekly advance is decelerating. This is normal during corrections within Stage 2, not a stage change signal.

**Verdict:** Unambiguous Stage 2. The path of least resistance on the weekly is higher.

### Daily Timeframe: LATE STAGE 2 WITH STAGE 3 WARNING SIGNS ⚠️

**Price Pattern:** The daily picture is more nuanced. Since the October breakout:
- Oct 27 week: Explosive move from ~$103 to $117 (likely earnings catalyst)
- Nov: Deep pullback to $96.55
- Dec: Recovery to $108, then selloff to $93.22
- Jan: Recovery, breakout above $112 on Jan 16 (heavy volume, 3346K)
- Feb 3-4: Push to $120.85 (new 52-week high)
- Feb 6: Sharp reversal to $105.01 intraday (4987K volume — heaviest day in months)
- Feb 7-13: Recovery to $113.25

The pattern since the $120.85 high is NOT the clean "up, steady, up" staircase of a healthy Stage 2 advance. It's volatile range-bound action with heavy volume — the textbook description of churning/distribution.

**Moving Average Alignment:**
- SMA5: $112.93 — flat
- SMA20: $113.29 — flat
- SMA50: $108.15 — rising
- SMA200: ~$100 (estimated from VWAP context) — rising

Price is sitting right at the SMA5/SMA20 convergence. The short-term MAs have flattened and are crossing — per Shannon, this is **indecision**, the hallmark of a transitional environment. However, the SMA50 and SMA200 remain below price with positive slopes.

**Daily RSI:** 53.3 — dead neutral. Neither trending nor oversold. Consistent with range-bound/transitional action.

**Daily MACD:** 1.489 (signal 1.992, histogram -0.503) — MACD above zero but histogram negative, confirming the deceleration of the short-term trend.

**Verdict:** The daily is transitioning from Stage 2 into a potential Stage 3 distribution zone. The SMA5/SMA20 crossing, neutral RSI, and heavy volume without directional progress are early distribution signals. However, price remains above the rising SMA50, so Stage 3 is NOT confirmed — it's a warning.

## 2. Moving Average Analysis

### Alignment Assessment

| Timeframe | Short MA | Intermediate MA | Long MA | Alignment | Slope |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Daily | SMA5: $112.93 | SMA20: $113.29 | SMA50: $108.15 | Converging (5 ≈ 20 > 50) | Short: flat, Int: flat, Long: rising |
| Weekly | 10w: $108.06 | 20w: $106.17 | 40w: $93.41 | Bullish (10w > 20w > 40w) | All rising |

**Key Observations:**
- The daily SMA5 and SMA20 have converged and are essentially flat at $113 — this is Shannon's "indecision zone." When short-term MAs cross, it represents confusion among short-term participants.
- The daily SMA50 at $108.15 is rising and well below price — this is the critical level to watch. As long as price holds above the rising SMA50, the daily Stage 2 uptrend is intact (if weakening).
- All weekly MAs are properly aligned and rising — the longer-term trend is unambiguously bullish.
- **The slope of the longer-term MAs (SMA50 daily, 40w weekly) is positive** — per Shannon, this means the odds favor rally attempts succeeding over failing. Failed rallies are more likely when longer-term MAs have negative slopes; that is NOT the case here.

### Dynamic Support/Resistance from MAs
- **SMA20 daily ($113.29):** Currently acting as pivot — price is oscillating around this level.
- **SMA50 daily ($108.15):** Rising dynamic support. The first meaningful defense line for bulls.
- **40-week SMA ($93.41):** The "last line of defense" for the weekly Stage 2 trend. A break below this level would signal a weekly stage change.

## 3. Volume Character

### Daily Volume Assessment

| Period | Avg Volume | Price Action | Interpretation |
|--------|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| 50-day average | 2,257K | Baseline | Reference level |
| 10-day average | 3,295K | Elevated 46% above 50d avg | Increased participation |
| Feb 3 (up day) | 2,990K | $116.89 → $119.43 | Above average on rally — bullish |
| Feb 4 (reversal) | 3,357K | Hit $120.85, closed $116.69 | Heavy volume bearish reversal — distribution |
| Feb 5 (down) | 3,753K | $113.39 → $113.87 | Heavy volume, minimal progress — churning |
| Feb 6 (big range) | 4,987K | Low $105.01, closed $112.64 | Heaviest volume in months — climactic selling + recovery |
| Feb 9-13 | 2,600-3,900K | $110-118 range | Elevated volume, range-bound — churning |

**Critical Volume Diagnosis:**

The volume pattern from Feb 3-13 is a **classic distribution signal** per Shannon's framework:

1. **Big volume without further upside progress** — The stock hit $120.85 on Feb 4 but couldn't hold it. The subsequent 8 sessions saw heavy volume (consistently above the 50-day average) but price went nowhere, oscillating in the $110-118 range. Shannon calls this "churning" — heavy trading activity without directional movement.

2. **Volume expanded on the pullback** — The Feb 4-6 decline from $120.85 to $105 occurred on expanding volume (3,357K → 3,753K → 4,987K). Per Shannon: "If volume expands on pullbacks, the strength of the trend should be questioned."

3. **The recovery from $105 also had elevated volume** — This could indicate accumulation at a higher level (bullish) or simply the other side of the distribution process. The fact that price recovered to $113 but NOT back to $120 makes this look more like a lower high forming.

**Weekly Volume:**
- The Feb 2 week (17,656K) and Feb 9 week (15,295K) were the two heaviest volume weeks in months, coinciding with the $120.85 test and subsequent failure.
- Per Shannon: "Large volume increases after a period of trending activity often signal that a powerful opposing force has entered and the trend may have reached exhaustion."

**Volume Verdict:** Volume is NOT confirming the uptrend at current levels. The volume character has shifted from "healthy Stage 2" (expanding on rallies, contracting on pullbacks) to "distribution" (heavy volume without directional progress). This is a **yellow flag**, not yet a red flag — the weekly trend's volume profile remains acceptable.

## 4. Key Support and Resistance Levels

### Resistance (overhead supply)

| Level | Source | Strength | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| **$114.99** | Daily VP VAH | Moderate | Upper boundary of daily value area — immediate resistance |
| **$115-116** | Multiple tests | Strong | Price has been rejected from $115-116 zone repeatedly (Jan 22: $115.95, Jan 29: $117, Feb 2: $116.44). This is where supply enters. |
| **$119.53** | Weekly VP VAH | Strong | Upper boundary of weekly value area — significant resistance |
| **$120.85** | 52-week high | Very Strong | The most important resistance level. A decisive break above this on volume would signal fresh Stage 2 momentum. The more times this level is tested, the more likely it breaks — but only with conviction. |

### Support (demand zones)

| Level | Source | Strength | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| **$112.36** | Daily VP POC | Strong | Point of control — highest volume price node over 6 months. This is where the most shares changed hands. Immediate support. |
| **$110** | Psychological/swing lows | Moderate | Multiple intraday bounces from $110-111 zone in Feb |
| **$108.15** | Daily SMA50 (rising) | Strong | Rising intermediate MA — Shannon's key dynamic support level. A close below this shifts the daily to bearish. |
| **$105** | Feb 6 swing low | Strong | Most recent higher low. **The critical stop-loss level for any long position.** A break below $105 negates the current consolidation as a Stage 2 pullback. |
| **$101.72** | Weekly VP POC | Very Strong | Point of control on the weekly — massive volume node. Also approximately where the 20-week SMA sits ($106). Major support zone $101-106. |
| **$98** | Daily VP VAL | Strong | Lower boundary of daily value area — breakdown target if $105 fails |
| **$93-96** | Dec low / Nov low | Very Strong | Prior correction lows. A break of this zone would be a weekly Stage 2 trend break. |

### Volume Profile Insight
The daily VP shows the heaviest trading concentration between $98 and $115 (the value area). Price is currently at the upper portion of this value area. The POC at $112.36 is right at current price — this means NVT is trading at the most "fair" price by volume. A move above $115 (VAH) would represent a breakout from the value area. A move below $98 (VAL) would represent a value area breakdown.

## 5. Multi-Timeframe Alignment

### Agreement Assessment

| Factor | Daily | Weekly | Aligned? |
|--------|-------|--------|----------|
| Stage | Late 2 / Early 3 warning | Stage 2 Markup | ⚠️ Diverging |
| MA alignment | Converging (indecision) | Bullish (all rising, properly stacked) | ⚠️ Diverging |
| MA slopes | Short-term flat, intermediate rising | All rising | ⚠️ Partially |
| Volume | Distribution signals (churning) | Elevated but acceptable | ⚠️ Mixed |
| Price vs key MAs | At SMA20, above SMA50 | Above all MAs | ✅ Both above |
| RSI | 53.3 (neutral) | 65.8 (bullish) | ⚠️ Diverging |
| Trend direction | Uncertain/transitional | Up | ⚠️ Diverging |

### Multi-Timeframe Verdict

**The daily and weekly are NOT in agreement.** The weekly is solidly Stage 2 bullish, but the daily is showing transitional/distributive characteristics.

Per Shannon's framework: **"When in doubt about the direction of trend, refer to the next larger timeframe."** The weekly is bullish, so the benefit of the doubt goes to the bulls. However, Shannon also says the **highest-probability trades come when there is alignment across multiple timeframes** — and that alignment is absent right now.

**This is NOT the time for a high-conviction new entry.** The weekly trend says NVT will likely resolve higher eventually, but the daily is telling us the stock needs time to work through this overhead supply zone. Per Shannon: "Short-term corrections occurring in the context of a longer-term timeframe typically will be resolved in the direction of the longer-term trend." The correction may not be over yet.

## 6. Risk/Reward Assessment

### Scenario A: Buy Here at $113.25

| Parameter | Level | Calculation |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Entry | $113.25 | Current price |
| Stop | $104.50 (below $105 swing low) | Risk: $8.75/share |
| Target 1 | $121 (prior high) | Reward: $7.75 → **0.9:1 R/R** ❌ |
| Target 2 | $130 (measured move) | Reward: $16.75 → **1.9:1 R/R** ❌ |

**Fails Shannon's 3:1 minimum.** Buying in the middle of a consolidation range with $9 of risk to the stop and only $8 to the first resistance level is a recipe for mediocre returns.

### Scenario B: Buy Pullback to SMA50 at ~$108

| Parameter | Level | Calculation |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Entry | $108 (at rising SMA50) | Wait for pullback |
| Stop | $104.50 (below $105 swing low) | Risk: $3.50/share |
| Target 1 | $121 (prior high) | Reward: $13 → **3.7:1 R/R** ✅ |
| Target 2 | $130 (measured move) | Reward: $22 → **6.3:1 R/R** ✅ |

**This is the Shannon trade.** Buy near the rising SMA50 with a tight stop below the swing low. Risk is compressed, reward is ample. The rising 50-day acts as dynamic support — if it holds, you're in early on the next leg. If it doesn't hold, your loss is small.

### Scenario C: Buy Breakout Above $121 (New High)

| Parameter | Level | Calculation |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Entry | $121.50 (above prior high) | Wait for breakout |
| Stop | $114.50 (below VAH / breakout level) | Risk: $7/share |
| Target | $135-140 (measured move from $105-121 range) | Reward: $14-19 → **2:1 to 2.7:1 R/R** ⚠️ |

Acceptable but not ideal. The breakout trade requires heavy volume confirmation. Given the distribution volume already seen at $120, be skeptical of weak breakout attempts. Only take this if volume on the breakout day exceeds the Feb 6 climactic volume (4,987K+).

## 7. Recommendation

### Stage Classification
- **Weekly: Stage 2 Markup** — firmly established, all MAs aligned and rising
- **Daily: Late Stage 2 / Stage 3 Transition Warning** — MAs converging, volume churning, price range-bound after hitting 52-week high

### Direction
**Bullish bias** — the weekly Stage 2 trend is the dominant force. Per Shannon, corrections within a weekly Stage 2 uptrend typically resolve to the upside. However, the daily distribution signals mean the resolution may take weeks, not days.

### Does This Favor a Trade NOW?

**No.** Conditions do NOT favor a new long entry at $113.25:

1. **Risk/reward fails the 3:1 test** at current levels
2. **Daily MAs are in indecision mode** (SMA5 ≈ SMA20, both flat) — per Shannon, MA crossovers are "a time to be out of the market, not to initiate trades"
3. **Volume is distributive** — heavy volume without upside progress at the $115-121 zone
4. **Multi-timeframe alignment is absent** — daily and weekly are not in agreement

### Action Plan

**IF ALREADY LONG:**
- Hold as long as price remains above $105 (the Feb 6 swing low)
- Tighten stop to $104.50
- Consider reducing position size given the daily distribution warnings
- The weekly Stage 2 trend is your anchor — trust it, but respect the daily's message

**IF LOOKING TO ENTER:**
- **Primary setup (Pullback Buy):** Wait for a pullback to the $107-109 zone (rising SMA50). Enter on the first higher high on the daily (short-term timeframe). Stop at $104.50. Target $121+. This gives you 3.5:1+ R/R.
- **Secondary setup (Breakout Buy):** Wait for a decisive close above $121 on volume exceeding 4M+ shares. This would clear all overhead supply and confirm the weekly Stage 2 trend is reasserting itself on the daily. Stop at $114.50. Target $135+.
- **What to avoid:** Do NOT buy the $115-121 resistance zone. This is where distribution is occurring. Buying into supply is the opposite of Shannon's methodology.

### Key Levels to Monitor

| Level | Significance | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| $121+ on volume | Breakout confirmation | Enter long (Scenario C) |
| $115 | Immediate resistance / daily VAH | Expect supply here |
| $112 | VP POC / current pivot | Price magnet |
| $108 | Rising SMA50 | Pullback buy zone (Scenario B) |
| $105 | Swing low (Feb 6) | Stop level for longs; break = Stage 2 daily failure |
| $101 | Weekly VP POC / 20w SMA | Major support; break = weekly trend threatened |

### Bottom Line

NVT has a strong weekly uptrend powered by a compelling fundamental story (NVIDIA liquid cooling partner, $2.3B backlog). The weekly Stage 2 trend favors higher prices over time. But the daily is going through a distribution process at the $115-121 resistance zone, and buying into distribution is a losing strategy. **Be patient.** Let the stock either pull back to give you a proper entry with 3:1+ R/R, or let it break out above $121 with volume conviction. The worst thing you can do is chase it in no-man's land at $113.

# CRDO (Credo Technology) — Multiple Timeframe Stage Analysis

**Date:** February 16, 2026  
**Price:** $121.44  
**Framework:** Brian Shannon's Technical Analysis Using Multiple Timeframes

---

## Executive Summary

**CRDO is in Stage 4 (Decline) on the daily timeframe and Stage 3 (Distribution) transitioning to Stage 4 on the weekly.** The stock has declined 43% from its $213.80 peak in early December 2025. A climactic washout to $94.19 on February 5 produced a relief bounce, but price now sits below all major daily moving averages and is being capped by the 200-day SMA at ~$122.50. **No trade is warranted at this time.** The stock remains "guilty until proven innocent."

---

## 1. Current Stage Identification

### Daily Timeframe: Stage 4 (Decline)

**Price action:** Clear pattern of lower highs and lower lows since the $213.80 peak:
- Dec 1 high: $213.80
- Dec 8 high: $181.00
- Jan 13 high: $164.74
- Jan 20 high: $158.87
- Feb 10 high: $142.00
- Current: $121.44

Lower lows sequence: $132.05 → $123.87 → $123.25 → $94.19. The decline is textbook Stage 4 — "chart moves from upper left to lower right."

**Caveat:** The Feb 5 low of $94.19 produced climactic selling volume (14.4M shares on Feb 4 — nearly 3x normal). This *could* mark the beginning of a bottoming process. But one washout does not make a Stage 1. Shannon: "Fear-driven liquidation plays out in multiple waves — not just one sell-off."

### Weekly Timeframe: Late Stage 3 / Early Stage 4

- **10-week SMA ($135.23):** Declining sharply (was $156.58 ten weeks ago — a 14% drop)
- **40-week SMA ($127.35):** Still rising (was $104.73 ten weeks ago) — but rate of ascent is decelerating
- **10w still above 40w:** The critical crossover has NOT yet occurred, but convergence is rapid
- **Price ($121.44) is below BOTH** the 10-week and 40-week SMAs

Per Shannon, when the short-term MA is declining toward the longer-term MA but hasn't crossed yet, this is the distribution/transition zone — "MA crossovers represent indecision." The 40-week's still-positive slope provides a thin thread of longer-term bull case, but price trading $6 below it is not encouraging.

**Weekly verdict:** The weekly is in the process of rolling over. The 40-week MA is still rising, which per Shannon means "benefit of the doubt should go to the side of the rising longer-term MA." But price is below it, the 10-week is plunging, and the crossover is imminent. This is late Stage 3 at best.

## 2. Moving Average Alignment & Slopes

### Daily MAs

| MA | Value | Slope | Position vs Price |
|----|-------|-------|-------------------|
| SMA5 | $125.95 | Declining | Above (resistance) |
| SMA20 | $126.05 | Declining | Above (resistance) |
| SMA50 | $141.54 | Declining sharply | Far above (resistance) |
| SMA200 | $122.50 | Flat to slightly declining | Essentially at price |

**Alignment: SMA5 ≈ SMA20 < SMA50 — all declining, all above price.** This is the Stage 4 signature: short-term < intermediate < long-term, all with negative slope.

The SMA5 and SMA20 have converged at ~$126, which reflects the recent sideways-to-down chop after the bounce. The SMA50 at $141.54 is far overhead — any rally will meet this wall of declining MA resistance.

**Critical observation:** The 200-day SMA at $122.50 is the immediate battleground. Price closed at $121.44 — just beneath it. Per Shannon: "In a downtrend, declining longer-term MAs act as dynamic resistance levels — rallies to declining MAs tend to encounter selling pressure." The 200 SMA is flat, not yet declining, which is the one neutral-to-positive datapoint. But flat = indecision, not bullish.

### Weekly MAs

| MA | Value | Slope | Position vs Price |
|----|-------|-------|-------------------|
| 10-week | $135.23 | Declining sharply | Above (resistance) |
| 40-week | $127.35 | Rising (decelerating) | Above (resistance) |

**10-week declining toward 40-week from above.** The crossover is imminent (gap has narrowed from $52 ten weeks ago to $8 now). When this cross occurs, it will confirm Stage 4 on the weekly.

## 3. Volume Character

### Climactic Selling Event (Feb 2–6)
- Feb 3: 10.9M (2x normal)
- Feb 4: 14.4M (3x normal) — price crashed from $108 to $97
- Feb 5: 8.2M — price hit $94.19 low
- Feb 6: 9.9M — bounce day to $111
- **Weekly total: 49.0M — the highest weekly volume in 2+ years by a wide margin**

This is Shannon's "climactic selling action" — the hallmark of late Stage 4 where "last of the stubborn longs liquidate in fear and disgust." This is a *necessary* condition for bottoming but not *sufficient*.

### Bounce Volume (Feb 9–10)
- Feb 9: 9.1M
- Feb 10: 12.6M — price surged to $142

The bounce came on *heavy* volume relative to the decline days (excluding the climactic days). Per Shannon: "If the stock rallies on heavier volume than it experienced during the decline, it could signal a change in trend direction." The Feb 10 bounce volume (12.6M) exceeded most decline days, which is a constructive signal. However, the rally from $111 to $142 has been entirely given back — price is back at $121. **The volume said "attention" but price has not confirmed.**

### Recent Volume (Feb 11–13)
- Feb 11: 9.9M
- Feb 12: 6.4M
- Feb 13: 4.5M — declining

Volume is *contracting* as price drifts lower from $134 to $121. In a Stage 4 context, Shannon notes: "Don't hold a long position because 'it's down on low volume' — stocks can experience dramatic declines in a simple absence of demand." However, the declining volume on this pullback from $142 is less alarming than the preceding crash volume — it *could* be a healthy digestion of the bounce. Needs confirmation.

## 4. Key Support & Resistance Levels

### From Volume Profile (Daily 6-Month)
| Level | Type | Significance |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **$94.19** | Major Support | Crash low, climactic volume — the line in the sand |
| **$100** | Psychological Support | Round number, traded heavily during crash |
| **$111–113** | Minor Support | Bounce base zone (Feb 6 close, Feb 9 open) |
| **$117** | Immediate Support | Feb 13 intraday low — most recent swing low |
| **$122.50** | Key Resistance | 200-day SMA — price is being capped here now |
| **$128.08** | Resistance | VP Value Area Low — price broke below this on the decline |
| **$135–142** | Resistance Zone | Recent bounce high ($142) + converging SMA5/20 + 40-week SMA |
| **$141.54** | Major Resistance | SMA50 — declining, will repel rallies |
| **$151.00** | Major Resistance | VP Point of Control — the most-traded price in 6 months |
| **$169.94** | Distant Resistance | VP Value Area High — upper bound of prior trading range |

### Polarity Principle in Action
The VP VAL at $128.08 was support during the October–January range. Now broken, per Shannon's polarity principle, it becomes resistance. Price attempted to reclaim it on Feb 10–11 ($134) but was rejected. This is textbook.

The VP POC at $151 represents the heaviest volume concentration — where the most participants established positions. Many are now trapped. Any rally toward $151 will be met with aggressive supply from these trapped longs looking to exit at breakeven. Shannon: "Positive news stories, stock splits, analyst upgrades are released but rally attempts are met with supply from large holders paring positions."

## 5. Multi-Timeframe Alignment

| Timeframe | Stage | Trend | MAs | Aligned? |
|-----------|-------|-------|-----|----------|
| **Daily** | Stage 4 (Decline) | Down | All declining, above price | ✅ Bearish |
| **Weekly** | Late Stage 3 → 4 | Transitioning Down | 10w declining, 40w still rising | ⚠️ Mixed |

**Alignment: NO — daily and weekly do NOT fully agree.**

The daily is clearly Stage 4. The weekly is in transition — the 40-week MA is still rising, which is the one holdout bull argument. Per Shannon: "When there is doubt about the direction of trend, refer to the next larger timeframe." The weekly's 40-week rising slope would normally suggest the daily decline is a correction within a larger uptrend.

**But context matters.** A 43% decline from $213 to $121 is not a "short-term correction." The magnitude of this move, the volume character, and the approaching 10w/40w crossover all suggest the weekly is catching up to the daily's bearish reality. The 40-week's rising slope is a lagging artifact of the massive 2024-2025 rally from ~$20 to $213. It will flatten and turn down within weeks as the math works against it.

**Shannon's verdict for this setup:** "The lowest-risk, highest-probability trades come when there is alignment of trend across multiple timeframes." We do NOT have that alignment. This alone disqualifies the setup from an actionable trade.

## 6. Risk/Reward Assessment

### Hypothetical Long Trade (NOT RECOMMENDED)

| Parameter | Level | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Entry** | $121.44 | Current price, at 200 SMA |
| **Stop (tight)** | $111 | Below recent swing low zone |
| **Stop (wide)** | $94 | Below crash low |
| **Target 1** | $142 | Recent bounce high |
| **Target 2** | $151 | VP POC |

**Tight stop scenario:** Risk = $10.44, Reward to T1 = $20.56, R:R = **2.0:1** ❌ (fails 3:1 minimum)  
**Tight stop to T2:** Risk = $10.44, Reward = $29.56, R:R = **2.8:1** ❌ (borderline, fails)  
**Wide stop to T2:** Risk = $27.44, Reward = $29.56, R:R = **1.1:1** ❌ (terrible)

**No scenario achieves Shannon's required 3:1 risk/reward ratio.** The overhead resistance is too dense ($128 VP VAL, $135 MA zone, $142 bounce high, $151 POC) relative to the distance to support. Every few dollars of upside meets a new wall of supply.

### Hypothetical Short Trade

| Parameter | Level | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Entry** | $121.44 | Current price |
| **Stop** | $135 | Above bounce high / declining 10-week SMA |
| **Target** | $94.19 | Retest of crash low |

Risk = $13.56, Reward = $27.25, R:R = **2.0:1** — better but still below 3:1. And shorting after a 43% decline near climactic volume lows is fighting the last war. Shannon: "Climactic selling action as last of the stubborn longs liquidate in fear and disgust" often precedes bottoming, not further decline.

## 7. Recommendation

### Stage: Daily Stage 4 (Decline) / Weekly Late Stage 3

### Direction: Down — but possibly late in the decline

### Key Levels:
- **Do not trade above:** $142 (requires reclaiming this to even *begin* questioning the downtrend)
- **Immediate resistance:** $122.50 (200 SMA), $128 (VP VAL)
- **Immediate support:** $117, $111
- **The line:** $94.19 — if this breaks, the next leg down accelerates

### Does This Favor a Trade NOW? **No.**

**Reasons:**

1. **Stage 4 on daily = "guilty until proven innocent."** Shannon is explicit: do not buy Stage 4 stocks. Rallies are counter-trend traps. "Today's hopeful buyers often become tomorrow's fearful sellers."

2. **Weekly is not yet Stage 4 but is rolling over.** The 40-week SMA is the last bull holdout, and it will flatten/decline within weeks. Buying into an approaching weekly 10/40 crossover is fighting the trend on the most powerful timeframe.

3. **Price is below ALL daily MAs.** This is the single most damning technical fact. In Shannon's framework, a stock trading below all its MAs has no business being bought. Period.

4. **R:R fails the 3:1 test.** Too much overhead resistance, too little reward relative to risk.

5. **Amazon concentration risk (42% of revenue).** A single customer concentration this high means any whisper of reduced orders or tariff impact could trigger another leg down. The technical setup offers no margin of safety for fundamental risk.

### What Would Change This Assessment:

To upgrade to a **WATCH** (potential Stage 1 accumulation):
- Price holds above $111 on the next pullback (higher low vs $94)
- Daily SMA5 and SMA20 begin to flatten and cross each other (currently both declining)
- Volume diminishes on subsequent pullbacks (showing sellers exhausting)
- Price reclaims and holds above the 200 SMA ($122.50) for multiple days

To upgrade to **ACTIONABLE** (potential early Stage 2 entry):
- A higher low above $111 FOLLOWED by a break above $142 (Feb 10 high)
- That breakout on expanding volume
- SMA20 turning up and crossing above flattening SMA50
- Weekly 10-week SMA stabilizing

**Timeline estimate:** At minimum 4–8 weeks of base-building before any Stage 2 signal could develop. Do not anticipate — wait for confirmation. Shannon: "The accumulation process moves stock from weak, uninterested hands to stronger buyers holding for longer periods." This process takes time.

### Current Posture: **Cash. No position. Watch list only.**

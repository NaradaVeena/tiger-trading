### Proformas & Trades
**No proformas pending.** No trades locked today.

### Exit Rules Check
- **ANET** -2.6% — well within tolerance. Thesis intact. No action.
- No positions down 15%+ or up 50%+.

### Observations
1. **ALAB** big bounce +4.7% but still in transition regime — RSI 38 oversold territory, watching for base formation.
2. **CRDO** strongest day +5.9%, regime improved to Goldilocks. Worth watching for 11 AM proforma evaluation.
3. **FN** quietly strong +3.8%, extended 39.5% above SMA200. Goldilocks regime but extension risk is real.
4. **ANET** our sole position is the only red name today (-1.7%). RSI 40.9 is constructive. MAs aligned. Patience.
5. **Macro shift to BULLISH** is notable — first time since portfolio inception. Sentiment risk-on + loose monetary = favorable backdrop.

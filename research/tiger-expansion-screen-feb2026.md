Below are 14 candidates across 6 layers of the stack, each profiled with financials and Tiger Portfolio fit assessment.

---

## Layer 1: Silicon & Compute

### 1. MRVL — Marvell Technology
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **What they do** | Custom AI silicon (XPUs) for hyperscalers + data center interconnect (PAM4 DSPs, electro-optics). Acquired Celestial AI (photonic fabric) Dec 2025 |
| **Latest revenue** | Q3 FY2026: $2.075B (+37% YoY) |
| **Gross margin** | ~59% (non-GAAP) |
| **Market cap** | ~$105B |
| **AI/DC revenue %** | 73% of total ($1.52B/quarter from data center) |
| **Key customers** | Amazon (custom Trainium silicon), Google, Microsoft, Meta |
| **Founder-led?** | No — CEO Matt Murphy (hired 2016, excellent operator) |
| **Moat** | Deep custom silicon design partnerships with 3+ hyperscalers; multi-year design wins are sticky. Celestial AI acquisition gives them photonic I/O — next-gen interconnect |
| **Tiger fit** | Strong. Custom silicon is the anti-NVIDIA bet — hyperscalers want alternatives. 73% DC revenue concentration is excellent. Earnings growth 81% FY2026E. This is the connective tissue between compute and networking |

### 2. CLS — Celestica Inc.
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **What they do** | Contract manufacturer of AI networking switches (800G), custom ASIC platforms for Google TPU, server racks |
| **Latest revenue** | Q4 2025: $3.65B (+44% YoY); FY2025: $12.4B (+28%) |
| **Gross margin** | 11.3% (adjusted — EMS business, not chip margins) |
| **Market cap** | ~$12B |
| **AI/DC revenue %** | Communications segment (AI switches) grew 79% YoY in Q4; ~60%+ of total |
| **Key customers** | Google (dominant), Meta, hyperscaler ASIC programs |
| **Founder-led?** | No — CEO Rob Mionis |
| **Moat** | Deep integration with Google's custom silicon program. Switching from EMS commodity to high-value AI hardware design. $1B capex plan announced |
| **Tiger fit** | Interesting as a "picks and shovels" play but EMS margins (11%) are thin. Google concentration risk. Growth is explosive but multiple expansion is the question |

### 3. TSEM — Tower Semiconductor
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **What they do** | Specialty foundry: silicon photonics (SiPho) for optical transceivers, RF chips, power management. Key enabler for 800G/1.6T optics |
| **Latest revenue** | Q4 2025: $440M record (+14% YoY, +11% QoQ); FY2025: $1.57B |
| **Gross margin** | ~23% (GAAP); improving rapidly with SiPho ramp |
| **Market cap** | ~$10B |
| **AI/DC revenue %** | SiPho + RF for data center = ~25-30% and accelerating fast. $920M capex committed to SiPho-SiGe expansion |
| **Key customers** | Nvidia (1.6T optical modules partnership), major transceiver OEMs |
| **Founder-led?** | Yes — CEO Russell Ellwanger (founder-like, at helm since 2005, 20+ years) |
| **Moat** | Only pure-play specialty foundry focused on SiPho at scale. Intel failed to acquire them (2022 deal blocked). Nvidia partnership validates the tech. $920M expansion creates capacity moat |
| **Tiger fit** | HIGH. This is a hidden gem. Founder-led, niche monopoly in silicon photonics fabrication, massive capex commitment signals confidence. As optical replaces copper in AI clusters, TSEM is the foundry. Small enough to be a multi-bagger |

---

## Layer 2: Connectivity & Networking

### 4. ANET — Arista Networks
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **What they do** | #1 Ethernet switching for AI/ML clusters (400G/800G). Software-defined networking (EOS). UEC founding member |
| **Latest revenue** | FY2025: $9.01B (+28.6%); Q4: $2.49B (+29%) |
| **Gross margin** | 64.6% (non-GAAP) — exceptional |
| **Market cap** | ~$130B |
| **AI/DC revenue %** | ~85%+ (cloud titans + enterprise data center) |
| **Key customers** | Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon (the big 4 cloud titans) |
| **Founder-led?** | Yes — Jayshree Ullal (CEO since 2008, co-founder-equivalent; Andy Bechtolsheim = actual founder/chairman) |
| **Moat** | EOS software moat (single binary image across all switches). 40%+ share in high-speed 400G/800G segment. UEC leadership positions them as InfiniBand replacement |
| **Tiger fit** | VERY HIGH. This is one of the best AI infrastructure plays, period. Founder-led, 65% gross margins, 29% growth, software moat. The InfiniBand→Ethernet transition is their mega-catalyst for 2026-2027. May be "too big" for Tiger at $130B, but the quality is undeniable |

### 5. APH — Amphenol Corporation
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **What they do** | Connectors, cables, interconnect assemblies for AI servers, data centers, defense. High-speed copper/optical interconnects for GPU clusters |
| **Latest revenue** | FY2025: $23.1B (+52% incl. acquisitions, +37% organic); Q4: $6.4B (+49%) |
| **Gross margin** | ~33% |
| **Market cap** | ~$100B |
| **AI/DC revenue %** | IT Datacom = 38% of Q4 sales, grew 110% YoY (AI-driven) |
| **Key customers** | Every hyperscaler, every AI server OEM, Nvidia (GPU interconnects) |
| **Founder-led?** | No — CEO Adam Norwitt (since 2005, 20+ year veteran, acts like a founder) |
| **Moat** | Decentralized operating model (120+ business units), breadth of interconnect products, acquisition machine ($8.4B in Q4 orders alone). Touches every cable/connector in AI infrastructure |
| **Tiger fit** | Strong but large. 37% organic growth is stunning for a $100B company. The "arms dealer" of AI connectivity — they win regardless of which GPU/switch wins. 38% of revenue from IT datacom growing 110% is the AI story |

---

## Layer 3: Optical & Photonics

### 6. LITE — Lumentum Holdings
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **What they do** | Optical transceivers, lasers (EMLs, VCSELs), optical circuit switches (OCS) for AI data centers. Upstream component supplier to FN/COHR |
| **Latest revenue** | Q1 FY2026 (Sep 2025): $533.8M (+58% YoY); FY2025: $1.645B (+21%) |
| **Gross margin** | ~42-45% (non-GAAP, improving) |
| **Market cap** | ~$37-39B |
| **AI/DC revenue %** | Cloud & Networking = 86% of FY2025 revenue. >60% from AI specifically |
| **Key customers** | Cloud hyperscalers (through transceiver OEMs), direct OCS sales to Google/Meta |
| **Founder-led?** | No — CEO Alan Lowe (veteran) |
| **Moat** | Leading in EML lasers (key component in 800G/1.6T transceivers), OCS is a new $100M/quarter revenue stream by late 2026. 40% capacity expansion underway |
| **Tiger fit** | STRONG. Upstream optical component provider — if FN and COHR are in Tiger, LITE is their supplier. 58% growth, 86% cloud/networking revenue. OCS is a new category they're creating. Higher up the value chain than pure assembly |

### 7. GLW — Corning Incorporated ⭐ (Poorna's pick)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **What they do** | Fiber optic cable, optical fiber, connectivity solutions for data centers. Also display glass, specialty materials |
| **Latest revenue** | FY2025: $15.63B; Q4: $4.215B. Optical Communications: $6.3B FY2025 (+35% YoY) |
| **Gross margin** | 38.1% (core); operating margin reached 20.2% in Q4 |
| **Market cap** | ~$45B |
| **AI/DC revenue %** | Optical Communications = 40% of revenue. Enterprise network business within that grew 61% in 2025. Data center-specific ~25-30% of total |
| **Key customers** | Meta ($6B multi-year deal announced Jan 2026), hyperscalers, telcos |
| **Founder-led?** | No — CEO Wendell Weeks (since 2005, 20+ year veteran) |
| **Moat** | Dominant fiber manufacturer globally. Proprietary glass science + manufacturing. Meta's $6B deal signals multi-year demand visibility. 171-year-old company with deep IP. High switching costs (fiber is infrastructure) |
| **Tiger fit** | SOLID. The Meta deal is transformative — $6B through 2030. Fiber is the literal foundation of AI data centers. 35% Optical segment growth, margin expansion to 20%, and they're still early in the AI cycle. Concern: diversified business (display, life sciences) dilutes the AI story. But the Optical segment alone would be a $6.3B company growing 35% |

---

## Layer 4: Power & Cooling

### 8. VRT — Vertiv Holdings
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **What they do** | Data center power (UPS, switchgear, PDUs), thermal management (liquid cooling, precision air), racks, monitoring software |
| **Latest revenue** | Q4 2025: $2.88B (+23% YoY); FY2025: ~$10.2B (+28%). Backlog: $15B (doubled) |
| **Gross margin** | ~37% (adjusted operating margin 22.3%) |
| **Market cap** | ~$95B |
| **AI/DC revenue %** | ~100% — pure-play data center infrastructure |
| **Key customers** | CoreWeave, Dell, all major hyperscalers, colocation providers |
| **Founder-led?** | No — CEO Giordano Albertazzi (since 2023) |
| **Moat** | End-to-end DC infrastructure portfolio (power + cooling + racks). Liquid cooling leadership via CoolTera acquisition. $15B backlog provides 2+ years visibility. Global service network |
| **Tiger fit** | VERY STRONG. Pure-play AI/DC infrastructure. The power/cooling bottleneck is the #1 constraint on AI buildout. $15B backlog, 252% organic order growth in Q4, liquid cooling ramp. Concern: $95B market cap means it's already well-discovered. But the backlog and order trajectory are extraordinary |

### 9. ETN — Eaton Corporation
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **What they do** | Electrical power management: transformers, switchgear, UPS, PDUs. HVDC infrastructure for AI data centers. Also aerospace, vehicle |
| **Latest revenue** | Q4 2025: $7.1B (+9% organic); FY2025: ~$26B. Electrical Americas Q4 operating margin: 29.8% |
| **Gross margin** | ~37% overall; Electrical Americas segment margins ~30% |
| **Market cap** | ~$130B |
| **AI/DC revenue %** | Electrical Americas = 46% of revenue. Data center orders +200% in Q4, sales +40%. Estimated 15-20% of total from DC |
| **Key customers** | Every data center builder, utilities, Nvidia (HVDC partnership) |
| **Founder-led?** | No — CEO Craig Arnold (since 2016) |
| **Moat** | Broadest electrical product portfolio globally. $340M SC transformer plant investment. Transformer supply chain bottleneck = pricing power. 150-year operating history |
| **Tiger fit** | Quality compounder but diversified. The AI/DC story is real (200% order growth) but buried inside a $130B conglomerate. Margins are excellent. Better as a "safe" AI play. Not the Tiger profile of concentrated AI pure-play, but undeniably benefits from the buildout |

### 10. MOD — Modine Manufacturing
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **What they do** | Data center cooling systems (precision air, liquid cooling CDUs), thermal management. Airedale by Modine brand |
| **Latest revenue** | FQ3 2026 (Dec 2025): Climate Solutions +24% YoY. Data center sales growing 70%+ YoY. FY2025 total: $2.6B |
| **Gross margin** | 22-25% (compressed by rapid capacity expansion; normalizing) |
| **Market cap** | ~$6B |
| **AI/DC revenue %** | Data center targeting $2B by FY2028 (from ~$700M currently, ~27% of total) |
| **Key customers** | AI infrastructure leaders (unnamed), hyperscalers |
| **Founder-led?** | No — CEO Neil Brinker (since 2020, transformation CEO) |
| **Moat** | Rapid capacity expansion ($100M+ investment), $180M single customer order. Niche cooling expertise. Smaller/nimbler than Vertiv. US manufacturing |
| **Tiger fit** | INTERESTING. Small cap ($6B), data center cooling is a massive bottleneck. 70%+ DC sales growth. Margin compression is temporary (capacity buildout). Path to $2B DC revenue by FY2028 = massive re-rating opportunity. Risk: execution on manufacturing ramp |

---

## Layer 5: Physical Infrastructure

### 11. EQIX — Equinix (Data Center REIT)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **What they do** | Largest data center REIT globally. Colocation, interconnection, xScale hyperscale program |
| **Latest revenue** | FY2025: ~$9B (+12% YoY) |
| **Gross margin** | N/A (REIT — AFFO margin ~45%) |
| **Market cap** | ~$90B |
| **AI/DC revenue %** | 100% data center |
| **Key customers** | Every major cloud provider, enterprise customers |
| **Founder-led?** | No — CEO Adaire Fox-Martin |
| **Moat** | Network effects (260+ DCs in 70+ metros), interconnection ecosystem, long-term leases |
| **Tiger fit** | REIT structure doesn't fit Tiger growth profile. Included for completeness. Stable compounder, not a Tiger pick |

---

## Layer 6: Testing & Enablement

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **What they do** | Semiconductor assembly equipment: wire bonding, advanced packaging (thermocompression, co-packaged optics tooling) |
| **Latest revenue** | Q4 FY2025: $177.6M (+20% YoY); FY2026 guidance: $730-740M |
| **Gross margin** | ~48% |
| **Market cap** | ~$3.5B |
| **AI/DC revenue %** | Advanced packaging for AI chips = growing rapidly but still minority. CPO (co-packaged optics) orders ramping |
| **Key customers** | TSMC, ASE, Amkor, major OSATs doing AI chip packaging |
| **Founder-led?** | Founded 1951, not founder-led today. CEO transition underway |
| **Moat** | Global leader in wire bonding (#1 market share). Advanced packaging tools for CoWoS, thermocompression bonding. Picks-and-shovels for AI chip packaging |
| **Tiger fit** | MODERATE. The advanced packaging thesis is real but KLIC is still in cyclical recovery. CPO orders are the catalyst. Small cap ($3.5B), high gross margins (48%), but revenue still modest. Watch for FY2026 execution |

### 13. AMKR — Amkor Technology
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **What they do** | Outsourced semiconductor assembly & test (OSAT). Advanced packaging services: 2.5D, fan-out, system-in-package for AI chips |
| **Latest revenue** | FY2025 estimated: ~$7.5B |
| **Gross margin** | ~15-17% (OSAT margins are thin) |
| **Market cap** | ~$7B |
| **AI/DC revenue %** | Growing — advanced packaging for AI accelerators is fastest-growing segment |
| **Key customers** | Apple, Qualcomm, AI chip designers |
| **Founder-led?** | Yes — founded by James Kim; now CEO Giel Rutten |
| **Moat** | #2 OSAT globally. Advanced packaging capacity at scale. Deep relationships with fabless designers |
| **Tiger fit** | LOW-MODERATE. Thin margins, OSAT is commoditizing. Advanced packaging is the exciting part but it's a minority of revenue. Not the Tiger quality profile |

### 14. AEHR — Aehr Test Systems
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **What they do** | Wafer-level burn-in and test systems. Specializes in testing SiC (silicon carbide) and now AI/HPC chips at wafer level |
| **Latest revenue** | FY2025 (May): ~$70M (small but growing) |
| **Gross margin** | ~50% |
| **Market cap** | ~$1B |
| **AI/DC revenue %** | AI/HPC test revenue emerging; historically SiC/EV focused |
| **Key customers** | SiC chipmakers, emerging AI chip test wins |
| **Founder-led?** | No — CEO Gayn Erickson |
| **Moat** | Niche wafer-level burn-in technology. Only pure-play in this space |
| **Tiger fit** | LOW. Too small, too early in AI pivot. SiC was their story, AI is a hope. Keep on radar but not ready for Tiger |

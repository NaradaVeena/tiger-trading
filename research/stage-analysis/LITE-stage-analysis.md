# LITE (Lumentum Holdings) — Multiple Timeframe Stage Analysis

**Date:** February 16, 2026
**Price:** $562.74
**Pipeline Rank:** #3
**Analyst:** Narada (Brian Shannon MTF Framework)

---

## Executive Summary

LITE is in a **confirmed Stage 2 uptrend** on both daily and weekly timeframes with perfect MA alignment. However, the stock has gone **parabolic** — up ~60% in the last 3 weeks alone — and is now massively extended from all moving averages. Per Shannon: *"The further a stock travels from a valid level of support, the riskier purchases are regardless of trend maturity."*

**Verdict: NOT an entry point. Wait for consolidation/pullback toward the 20-day SMA (~$440-450) for a tradeable R/R.**

## 1. Current Stage Identification

### Daily Timeframe: Stage 2 (Late / Parabolic Extension)

- **Price pattern:** Textbook higher highs and higher lows since mid-2025. The staircase pattern has recently gone vertical.
- **MA alignment:** SMA5 ($572) > SMA20 ($442) > SMA50 ($391) > SMA200 ($201) — perfect bullish stack
- **MA slopes:** All rising, with short-term MAs accelerating steeply upward
- **RSI:** 72.1 — entering overbought territory
- **MACD:** 59.6 vs Signal 44.2, histogram positive and expanding (+15.5)

**Stage 2 confirmed,** but late-stage warning signs are present: greed-driven vertical acceleration, price far above all MAs.

### Weekly Timeframe: Stage 2 (Mature / Extended)

- **Price pattern:** Unbroken series of higher highs and higher lows for 52+ weeks. From ~$78 to $563 = +617%.
- **MA alignment:** SMA5 ($434) > SMA20 ($312) > SMA50 ($181) — perfect bullish stack, all rising sharply
- **RSI:** 84.8 — deeply overbought (highest level in the entire trend)
- **MACD:** 88.9 vs Signal 69.8, histogram expanding (+19.1) — maximum momentum reading

**Stage 2 confirmed on weekly.** The RSI at 84.8 is an extreme reading. Shannon's framework warns: *"Greed-driven fast rallies should alert you to monitor short-term charts closely — these stocks can decline faster than they rallied."*

## 2. Moving Average Alignment & Slopes

| MA | Daily Value | Weekly Value | Slope | Distance from Price |
|----|-----------|-------------|-------|-------------------|
| SMA5 | $571.72 | $434.00 | Steep up ↑↑ | -1.6% / -23% |
| SMA20 | $441.88 | $311.88 | Rising ↑ | -21.5% / -44.5% |
| SMA50 | $390.61 | $180.66 | Rising ↑ | -30.6% / -67.9% |
| SMA200 | $200.79 | N/A | Rising ↑ | -64.3% / N/A |

**Key observations:**
- **Perfect bullish alignment** on both timeframes — short > intermediate > long, all rising
- **Extreme extension:** Price is 27% above the daily 20-SMA and 44% above the daily 50-SMA. This is parabolic territory.
- The 200-day SMA at $201 is rising steadily — the long-term trend "voice" is unambiguously bullish
- However, the gap between the 5-SMA and 20-SMA is widening rapidly — a rubber band stretched too far

**Shannon interpretation:** The MA alignment confirms strong Stage 2. But the degree of separation between price and the longer MAs signals extreme overextension. Pullbacks to the 20-SMA have historically been the re-entry zones in trending stocks. A pullback to the ~$440 area would be normal and healthy.

## 3. Volume Character

### Daily Volume Assessment
- **Recent surge:** Massive volume expansion on the move from ~$350 to $600 — the last 2-3 weeks show the highest volume bars of the entire trend
- **Green dominance:** Up-day volume significantly outweighs down-day volume during the surge
- **Confirmation vs. Exhaustion:** While volume expanding in trend direction is bullish confirmation, Shannon also warns: *"Large volume after extended trending often signals that a powerful opposing force has entered and the trend may have reached exhaustion"* and *"Large volume increases after a period of trending activity often precede a turning point"*

### Weekly Volume Assessment
- Volume on the most recent weekly candle (which includes the parabolic spike to $604 and pullback to $563) is enormous
- This type of high-volume, high-range candle at the end of an extended trend is a classic exhaustion signal

### Volume Verdict
**Mixed.** Volume confirms the trend direction (bullish), but the sheer magnitude of volume after an already extended move is a classic distribution/exhaustion warning. The "dumb money" is likely piling in after the move has already happened. Per Shannon: *"News stories motivate the most emotional participants to enter after a meaningful move has already occurred. Once the dumbest money is in, who is left to buy?"*

## 4. Key Support & Resistance Levels

### From Volume Profile Data

| Level | Type | Significance |
|-------|------|-------------|
| $603.83 | Resistance | Recent high / all-time high — untested |
| $562.74 | Current Price | — |
| ~$440-450 | Support | 20-day SMA zone, first meaningful support |
| $390 | Support | 50-day SMA, prior consolidation zone |
| $349.30 | Support (VP VAH) | Value Area High from 6mo VP — prior resistance now support |
| $278.23 | Support (VP VAH 1Y) | Value Area High from 1-year VP |
| ~$300-350 | Major Support | Extended consolidation zone (Oct-Dec 2025) — heavy volume traded here |
| $200 | Support | 200-day SMA zone |
| $164.57 | Support (VP POC 6mo) | Point of Control — highest volume node |
| $68.91 | Support (VP POC 1Y) | Point of Control yearly — legacy base |

### Key Observations
- **No overhead resistance** — price is in blue sky after clearing $400 and then $500. No prior sellers trapped above.
- **First real support** isn't until the $440 area (20-day SMA) — a ~22% decline from current levels
- **The $300-350 zone** was a multi-month consolidation area with heavy volume — this is the major structural support
- **VP POC at $69-165** is irrelevant for current trading but shows how far the stock has traveled from its value area — extremely extended

## 5. Multi-Timeframe Alignment

| Timeframe | Stage | Trend | MA Alignment | Confirmation |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Weekly | Stage 2 | Strong uptrend | Bullish stack, all rising | ✅ Confirmed |
| Daily | Stage 2 | Strong uptrend (parabolic) | Bullish stack, all rising | ✅ Confirmed |

**Alignment: Perfect.** Both timeframes agree — unambiguous Stage 2 uptrend.

Per Shannon's framework, the highest-probability trades occur when trends align across multiple timeframes, and LITE has that. The longer-term weekly trend is powerfully bullish, which means pullbacks on the daily timeframe are likely to resolve higher.

**But alignment alone doesn't justify entry.** The framework also demands favorable R/R, and the current extension makes that impossible.

## 6. Risk/Reward Assessment

### Scenario A: Buy Now at $562.74

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Entry | $562.74 |
| Stop (below recent swing low / 20-SMA) | $440 |
| Risk per share | $122.74 (21.8%) |
| Target (blue sky — estimated) | $700 (round number resistance) |
| Reward per share | $137.26 |
| **R/R Ratio** | **1.1:1** ❌ |

**Fails the 3:1 minimum.** Even with an aggressive upside target, the required stop is so far away that the math doesn't work.

### Scenario B: Buy Pullback to 20-SMA (~$450)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Entry | $450 |
| Stop (below 50-SMA / consolidation) | $380 |
| Risk per share | $70 (15.6%) |
| Target (retest of highs / $600+) | $600 |
| Reward per share | $150 |
| **R/R Ratio** | **2.1:1** ⚠️ (close but not quite 3:1) |

### Scenario C: Buy Consolidation Breakout (~$400-420 base)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Entry | $420 (hypothetical breakout from pullback consolidation) |
| Stop (below consolidation low) | $380 |
| Risk per share | $40 (9.5%) |
| Target (prior highs at $600) | $600 |
| Reward per share | $180 |
| **R/R Ratio** | **4.5:1** ✅ |

**Only Scenario C meets Shannon's 3:1 requirement,** and that requires patience — waiting for the stock to pull back, consolidate, and break out again.

## 7. Recommendation

### ❌ DO NOT BUY HERE

**The trend is indisputably bullish — the setup is not.**

LITE is a textbook Stage 2 stock with perfect multi-timeframe alignment, strong fundamental catalysts (58% revenue growth, 86% cloud/networking exposure, AI infrastructure buildout), and massive momentum. It is the kind of stock you want to own.

But Shannon's framework is clear: **entry timing matters as much as trend identification.** Buying a stock that is 27% above its 20-day SMA, with RSI at 72 (daily) / 85 (weekly), after a 60% surge in 3 weeks, violates every risk management principle in the framework:

1. *"The further a stock travels from a valid level of support, the riskier purchases are regardless of trend maturity"*
2. *"Greed-driven fast rallies should alert you to monitor short-term charts closely — these stocks can decline faster than they rallied"*
3. The R/R from current levels is ~1:1 — well below the 3:1 minimum

### 📋 Action Plan

1. **Add to watchlist with high priority alerts** at $440 and $400
2. **Wait for a pullback** — the first meaningful correction in a strong Stage 2 trend is typically a buying opportunity
3. **Ideal entry zone:** $400-450 (20-50 SMA area on daily), with a stop below $380
4. **Watch for:** A consolidation pattern (higher lows forming) near the MAs, followed by a breakout on increasing volume — that's the Shannon entry signal
5. **If it never pulls back:** Let it go. There are always other setups. Chasing parabolic moves is how traders get burned.

### ⚠️ Key Risk: Parabolic Reversal

The most dangerous phase of any Stage 2 trend is the terminal acceleration. When a stock goes parabolic:
- The last buyers are the most emotional and least informed
- The reversal, when it comes, is typically swift and violent
- Shannon: *"These stocks can decline faster than they rallied"*

If LITE reverses hard from $600, the first real support isn't until $350-400. That's a potential 30-40% drawdown. Buying now puts you at the epicenter of that risk.

### Bottom Line

**LITE is the right stock (Stage 2, aligned, strong fundamentals). This is the wrong price.** Be patient. Let it come to you.

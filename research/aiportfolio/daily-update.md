# Tiger Portfolio Daily Update
**Monday, February 16, 2026 (Presidents' Day - Markets Closed)**
**Analysis for Tuesday, February 17 Open**

## Market Context
Markets closed for Presidents' Day. This analysis is forward-looking for Tuesday's open.

## Proforma Trade: NVT Starter Position
**PROPOSED: BUY 44 shares NVT @ $113.25 = $4,983 (5% allocation)**

### Reasoning
- **Volume Node Entry**: Price at $113.25 sits directly on VP POC at $112.36 - textbook volume support
- **MA Confluence**: Right at SMA5/20 intersection (~$113), clean technical setup  
- **RSI Neutral**: 53.3 provides room to run without chasing momentum
- **Defined Path**: Clear breakout above $121 (6.8% upside) for second tranche
- **Risk Management**: Thesis invalidation at $86 provides defined stop

### Why NVT Over Others?
1. **ALAB**: Beat earnings Feb 10 + strong guidance, but price $129.32 still below VP value area ($138.94 VAL). Classic "beat + sell" - wait for bounce quality.

2. **CRDO**: Had "blowout news" Feb 11, surged 10.78% and holding. Price $121.44 just below VAL $128.08 - close second choice but NVT cleaner.

3. **FN**: Shows strength ($495.55, above all SMAs, within VP value area) but already extended from our entry zones.

4. **COHR/PWR**: Both confirmed "thin air" warnings. COHR at $217.23 vs VAH $187.46, PWR at $524.08 vs VAH $483.19. Avoid.

## Technical Summary

| Ticker | Price | RSI | VP Position | Signal |
|--------|-------|-----|-------------|--------|
| ALAB | $129.32 | 38.8 | Below VAL | Wait for volume entry |
| CRDO | $121.44 | 45.0 | Below VAL | Secondary choice |  
| **NVT** | **$113.25** | **53.3** | **At POC** | **PRIMARY ENTRY** |
| FN | $495.55 | 54.5 | In value area | Extended |
| COHR | $217.23 | 53.9 | Above VAH | Thin air - avoid |
| PWR | $524.08 | 67.5 | Above VAH | Extended - avoid |

## Fundamental Alignment
No contradiction between fundamentals and technicals on NVT. Solid diversified business (no customer >12%), clean balance sheet, positioned for AI infrastructure buildout. Chart says "now" at volume node.

**Next Steps**: Group review → 2 PM lock if approved → Begin building core position on successful $121 breakout.

**Date:** February 16, 2026
**Price:** $217.23
**Analyst:** Narada (Brian Shannon MTF Framework)
**Classification:** Watch / Late Stage 2 with Distribution Warnings

---

## 1. Stage Identification

### Daily Timeframe: Late Stage 2 → Early Stage 3 Transition Warning

**MA Structure (Daily):**
| MA | Value | Slope | Price Relative |
|----|-------|-------|----------------|
| SMA5 | $225.57 | Rising | BELOW |
| SMA20 | $213.70 | Rising | ABOVE |
| SMA50 | $196.84 | Rising (steep) | ABOVE |
| SMA200 | $127.01 | Rising (steep) | ABOVE |

**MA alignment is bullish:** SMA5 > SMA20 > SMA50 > SMA200, all with positive slope. This is textbook Stage 2 alignment.

**BUT — the price action tells a different story.** The stock hit $247.15 on Feb 9 and has since printed four consecutive lower closes: $228.37 → $223.69 → $216.10 → $217.23. Price is now BELOW the 5-day MA and sitting right on the 20-day MA — the first line of support. RSI at 53.9 is middling for a stock near its ATH. MACD histogram has turned negative (-0.89).

**Critical daily swing analysis (last 30 days):**
- Swing highs: $200 → $211 → $213 → $223 → $237 → $241 → **$247** → $238 ← **First lower high**
- Swing lows: $177 → $167 → $183 → $186 → $190 → $206 → $208 → **$175** (Feb 5 flash) → $209

The Feb 5 intraday crash to $175.24 (a 27% drawdown from $241.50 high just one day prior) is a massive red flag. That kind of volatility in an uptrend is Shannon's "late Stage 2 warning sign" — greed-driven fast rallies followed by violent reversals. The stock recovered, but the scar tissue is there.

**Daily verdict: Stage 2, but exhibiting late-stage exhaustion characteristics. The 20-day MA ($213.70) is the tripwire — a close below it shifts us to "transition zone."**

### Weekly Timeframe: Stage 2 (Confirmed, No Ambiguity)

**MA Structure (Weekly):**
| MA | Value | Slope (5wk change) | Price Relative |
|----|-------|---------------------|----------------|
| 10-week | $197.33 | +$26.56 (rising fast) | ABOVE |
| 30-week | $145.47 | +$19.76 (rising) | ABOVE |
| 40-week | $130.15 | +$18.19 (rising) | ABOVE |

**MA alignment:** 10w > 30w > 40w, all rising. Classic Stage 2.

**Weekly swing pattern:**
- Higher highs: $123 → $169 → $200 → $247 ✓
- Higher lows: $108 → $124 → $130 → $170 → $167 → $175 — **the lows are getting messy.** $167 (Jan 5 week) undercut $170 (Dec 15 week). $175 (Feb 2 week) formed a slightly higher low vs $167 but represents a SECOND test of the ~$170 area. Shannon says: "The more times a level is tested, the more likely it is to be violated."

**Weekly verdict: Stage 2, but the higher low pattern is becoming ragged. The weekly uptrend remains intact as long as $167 holds on a closing basis.**

## 2. Moving Average Alignment — Detailed Assessment

### Bullish Factors
- All daily MAs are rising and properly stacked (short > intermediate > long)
- All weekly MAs are rising and properly stacked
- SMA200 at $127 — extremely far below price — the long-term trend is decisively bullish
- SMA50 at $197 has strong positive slope — intermediate buyers are firmly in control

### Bearish/Warning Factors
- **Price has dropped below SMA5** — the shortest-term trend participants are losing money
- **The gap between price and SMA50 ($20 or ~10%) and SMA200 ($90 or ~71%) is extreme** — Shannon explicitly warns: "The further a stock travels from a valid level of support, the riskier purchases are regardless of trend maturity"
- MACD bearish crossover on daily — momentum is decelerating
- The SMA5 will curl down shortly given the 4-day slide, which will be the first MA to break alignment

**MA Assessment: Structurally bullish but over-extended. The MAs haven't broken yet, but price is telling them to catch up. A mean-reversion pullback to the SMA20 ($213) or SMA50 ($197) would be normal and healthy.**

## 3. Volume Character — THIS IS THE CRITICAL CONCERN

### Daily Volume Analysis
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 50-day avg volume | 4.9M |
| Last 20 days — up day avg vol | 5.8M (9 days) |
| Last 20 days — down day avg vol | 6.0M (11 days) |

**This is NOT healthy Stage 2 volume.** Shannon's rule: "Increasing volume on rallies, diminishing volume on pullbacks" = healthy uptrend. COHR shows:

- **More down days (11) than up days (9)** in the last 20 sessions
- **Higher average volume on down days** (6.0M vs 5.8M)
- **Feb 4: 13.4M shares** on a -9.3% day — nearly 3x average. This is institutional distribution.
- **Feb 5: 12.9M shares** on a massive whipsaw ($175 low, $209 close) — panic + scramble
- **Feb 10-12: 7.5M, 5.6M, 6.7M** all on declining days — above-average volume on the decline from $247

Shannon's framework is explicit: "If volume expands on pullbacks, the strength of the trend should be questioned." Volume IS expanding on pullbacks here. "Big volume without further upside = classic distribution signal."

### Weekly Volume Analysis
- 20-week avg: 22.0M
- Feb 2 week: 45.0M (2x average) — massive volume, but the week ended up only 9% and included the crash to $175
- Feb 9 week: 29.8M (1.35x average) — above average on a DOWN week (-4.3%)

**Volume Verdict: Distribution is occurring. Large players are using strength to sell into. The volume pattern over the last 3 weeks is textbook Shannon distribution: heavy volume without sustained upside progress. This doesn't mean the stock collapses tomorrow, but it means the easy money in this move is done.**

## 4. Key Support and Resistance Levels

### Resistance
| Level | Source | Significance |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **$247.15** | ATH (Feb 9 intraday) | Primary resistance — all-time high, round number psychology near $250 |
| **$241.50** | Feb 3 intraday high | Secondary resistance — the prior swing high before the crash |
| **$237.18** | Jan 30 intraday high | Cluster of highs in the $237-247 zone |

### Support
| Level | Source | Significance |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **$213.70** | SMA20 (daily) | First support — being tested NOW. Close below this = short-term trend break |
| **$209** | Feb 12 swing low | Most recent daily swing low — bull/bear line for the short-term |
| **$196.84** | SMA50 (daily) / ~$197 weekly 10MA | Major support — loss of this = intermediate trend break |
| **$187.46** | VP Value Area High (6mo) | Volume profile support — this is where real traded volume begins |
| **$175** | Feb 5 crash low / weekly swing low | Critical weekly support |
| **$167.50** | Jan 9 crash low | Absolute line in the sand for weekly Stage 2 |

### Volume Profile (THE KEY STRUCTURAL ISSUE)
| VP Level | Value |
|----------|-------|
| POC (6mo) | $91.13 |
| VAH (6mo) | $187.46 |
| VAL (6mo) | $84.35 |
| POC (1yr) | $90.93 |
| VAH (1yr) | $149.72 |

**The volume profile confirms the "thin chart structure" thesis.** The 6-month VP Point of Control is at $91 — the stock has spent the majority of its trading time down there. The Value Area High at $187 means that only a tiny fraction of total volume has been traded above $187. The stock is essentially in uncharted, volume-void territory above $187.

**This means: if the stock breaks below $187, there is very little volume-based support until $150 (1yr VAH) or even $91 (POC). The floor is thin.**

Per Shannon: "The strength of S/R is influenced by time to form, volume during formation, and recency." There has been virtually no time or volume creating support in the $190-240 range. Any support here is fragile.

## 5. Multi-Timeframe Alignment Assessment

| Criterion | Daily | Weekly | Aligned? |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|
| Stage | Late 2 / Transition | Stage 2 | ⚠️ Partially |
| MA Alignment | Bullish (all rising, stacked) | Bullish (all rising, stacked) | ✅ Yes |
| Price vs MAs | Above all, but dropping toward SMA20 | Above all | ✅ Yes |
| Volume | Distribution pattern | Heavy vol, mixed direction | ⚠️ Concerning |
| Momentum | MACD bearish crossover, RSI 54 | N/A | ⚠️ Weakening |
| Price Pattern | Potential lower high forming | Higher highs intact, lows getting messy | ⚠️ Mixed |

**Alignment Verdict: The weekly is still cleanly Stage 2. The daily is starting to show cracks. Shannon's rule: "When in doubt about the direction of trend, refer to the next larger timeframe." The weekly says bullish. But the daily is where the real-time deterioration is happening, and daily leads weekly — if the daily breaks down, the weekly will follow.**

**The critical question: Is this a normal Stage 2 correction (broken stairstep), or the beginning of Stage 3 distribution?**

Arguments for "healthy correction":
- Weekly MAs all rising, properly stacked
- Stock already showed this pattern in Nov-Dec (crash from $168 to $130, recovered to $247)
- The 10-week MA at $197 is close to SMA50 — a pullback to this level would be a textbook Stage 2 re-entry

Arguments for "distribution beginning":
- Volume is heavier on down days — institutional selling
- Extreme volatility (Feb 4-5 whipsaw) is Shannon's classic late Stage 2 warning
- Three attempts at $240+ all met with aggressive selling
- The stock is 71% above its 200-day MA — extreme extension
- Multiple crashes to the $167-175 zone suggest a growing pool of trapped buyers

## 6. Risk/Reward Assessment

### Scenario A: Long Entry on Pullback to SMA50 (~$197)
- **Entry:** $197
- **Stop:** Below $187 (VP VAH) = $186, risk = $11/share (5.6%)
- **Target:** $247 (ATH retest) = profit = $50/share
- **R:R = 4.5:1** ✅ Meets 3:1 threshold
- **Probability:** Moderate. Requires the weekly uptrend to remain intact and volume to confirm the hold at $197. The SMA50 + weekly 10MA confluence at ~$197 makes this a high-quality support level IF the trend is real.

### Scenario B: Long Entry at Current Price ($217)
- **Entry:** $217
- **Stop:** Below $209 (recent swing low) = risk = $8/share (3.7%)
- **Target:** $247 = profit = $30/share
- **R:R = 3.75:1** ✅ Meets threshold on paper
- **Probability:** LOW. The stop at $209 is too tight given recent volatility (the stock has had $30+ intraday ranges). You will get stopped out on noise. And if $209 breaks, the volume void below means $187 is the next real support — you're looking at a $30 loss, not $8.
- **Adjusted R:R with realistic stop at $187:** Risk = $30, reward = $30. **R:R = 1:1.** ❌ Does NOT meet threshold.

### Scenario C: Wait for Stage 3 Confirmation / Breakdown
- No trade. Wait for either:
  - (a) A clean pullback to SMA50 ($197) with volume contraction, then re-entry on first higher high
  - (b) Breakdown below $167 weekly support, then short on the first lower high

## 7. Recommendation

### STAGE: Late Stage 2 (Daily) / Stage 2 (Weekly)
### DIRECTION: Bullish intermediate-term, but short-term distribution in progress
### TRADE NOW: NO ❌

**Rationale:**

COHR is a powerful Stage 2 stock on the weekly timeframe — no question. The 10w > 30w > 40w alignment with all MAs rising steeply is textbook. The stock has gone from $46 to $247 in under a year. The fundamental story (4x book-to-bill, InP vertical integration) supports continued demand.

**But the current setup is NOT a Shannon entry.** Here's why:

1. **Extended from support.** Price is $20 above the SMA20 and $90 above the SMA200. Shannon: "The further a stock has traveled from a valid level of support, the riskier purchases are." Buying here means your stop is either too tight (noise) or too far (poor R:R).

2. **Volume is distributional.** Down-day volume exceeds up-day volume. The Feb 4 (13.4M) and Feb 5 (12.9M) sessions were institutional liquidation events. Three attempts at $240+ met heavy selling. Shannon: "Big volume without further upside = classic distribution signal."

3. **The thin volume profile is a trapdoor.** VP POC at $91, VAH at $187. There's almost no volume-based support between $190 and $247. If this breaks, it's air. Shannon's S/R framework says support is only valid when formed by time, volume, and recency. None of those exist above $187.

4. **The "broken stairstep" pattern is concerning.** The Feb 5 crash to $175 created a swing low BELOW the prior Dec swing low of $170. While the weekly chart held (barely), this kind of volatile undercutting erodes the reliability of the staircase pattern.

### What I'm Watching For

**Bullish re-entry signal (Scenario A):**
- Price pulls back to $195-200 (SMA50 / weekly 10MA confluence)
- Volume contracts during the pullback (shows sellers are NOT motivated)
- Stock holds above $187 (VP VAH)
- First higher high on daily after the pullback = entry trigger
- Stop below $187, target $247+

**Distribution confirmation (go to cash/avoid):**
- Close below $187 on above-average volume
- SMA20 crosses below SMA50 (daily)
- Weekly 10MA flattens or turns down
- Lower high on weekly below $247

### Key Levels Summary
| Level | Significance |
|-------|-------------|
| $247 | ATH resistance — the ceiling |
| $225 | SMA5 — broken, bearish short-term |
| $214 | SMA20 — current battleground |
| $197 | SMA50 / Weekly 10MA — ideal pullback entry zone |
| $187 | VP VAH — hard stop level, volume support begins |
| $175 | Feb 5 crash low — weekly support |
| $167 | Jan 9 crash low — weekly Stage 2 failure point |
| $150 | 1yr VP VAH — deep support |
| $127 | SMA200 — nuclear option |

## Summary

COHR is a strong Stage 2 stock that has made an extraordinary move. The weekly trend is intact and the fundamental catalyst is real. But the daily timeframe is showing classic late-Stage 2 distribution symptoms: extreme volatility, volume expanding on declines, and price failing to sustain above $240 despite multiple attempts.

**This is a "right stock, wrong price" situation.** The stock needs to either:
- Pull back to the SMA50/10-week MA ($195-200) and form a constructive base with contracting volume, OR
- Consolidate sideways for several weeks to let the MAs catch up

Buying at $217 with distribution volume and a thin floor underneath violates Shannon's core risk management principles. Patience here will be rewarded — either with a better entry or a bullet dodged.

**Bottom line: COHR is a Stage 2 WATCH, not a Stage 2 BUY at current levels.**

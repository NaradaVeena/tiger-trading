## Executive Summary

FN is in **Stage 2 (Markup)** on both the daily and weekly timeframes. The stock has completed a textbook "broken stairstep" correction — a pullback from the $531 ATH to the ~$400 area in January, followed by a strong recovery to $495. Moving averages are properly aligned and rising. However, the current entry at $495 presents a suboptimal risk/reward — price has already recovered significantly from the correction low, and the distance to the stop exceeds the distance to the first resistance target. **Wait for a pullback to the MA cluster at $475-478 for a 3:1 setup.**

## 1. Current Stage Identification

### Daily Timeframe: STAGE 2 (Markup) — Mid-to-Late Cycle

**Price Structure:**
- Higher highs and higher lows intact over the trailing 6+ months
- Aug 2025 low ~$272 → Nov high ~$480 → correction to ~$400 → Dec ATH $531 → Jan correction to ~$400 → recovery to $495
- The Jan correction created a potential **double-bottom** at the ~$400 level, which is textbook "broken stairstep" behavior in a Stage 2 uptrend
- Price is now making a renewed push higher from the correction low — this is Shannon's "re-emerging from correction back into the direction of the primary trend"

**MA Alignment:**
| Moving Average | Value | Slope | Position vs Price |
|---|---|---|---|
| SMA 5 | $478.26 | Positive (flattening) | Below price |
| SMA 20 | $478.56 | Positive | Below price |
| SMA 50 | $475.44 | Positive | Below price |
| SMA 200 | $366.19 | Strongly positive | Well below price |

- **Short-term MA ≈ Intermediate MA > Long-term MA** — all rising, price above all
- SMA5 and SMA20 are essentially equal ($478.26 vs $478.56), indicating a brief pause in the very short-term momentum after the recovery rally
- SMA50 rising at $475 — the "broken stairstep" correction successfully held above the 50-day
- SMA200 rising steeply at $366 — the "voice of the market" is decisively bullish. Per Shannon: "rising longer-term MA means longer-term players are confident"

**Stage 2 Confirmation Checklist:**
- ✅ Higher highs, higher lows (macro trend)
- ✅ Price above all major MAs
- ✅ Short > Intermediate > Long MA alignment
- ✅ All MAs rising
- ✅ SMA200 slope strongly positive
- ⚠️ SMA5 ≈ SMA20 convergence = very short-term momentum pause (not bearish, just neutral)

### Weekly Timeframe: STAGE 2 (Markup) — Powerful Primary Uptrend

**Inferred from 1-year daily chart (weekly data source limited):**
- Price has advanced from ~$150 (Feb 2025) to $495 — a **230% move** in 12 months
- The weekly trend is an unambiguous Stage 2: lower-left to upper-right, staircase pattern
- SMA200 (daily) at $366 is rising steeply, serving as a proxy for the weekly intermediate MA — it's been untouched since the trend began
- 52-week range: $148.55 - $531.22 — price at $495 is in the upper 7% of the range
- 1-year return: +113.63%

**Weekly Stage 2 Confidence: HIGH.** The primary trend is one of the strongest in the market. The path of least resistance is higher until proven otherwise.

## 2. Moving Average Analysis — Detailed

### Alignment Assessment
The MA stack is properly bullish: **5 > 20 > 50 > 200**, all with positive slopes. This is the Shannon signature for "buyers in control across all timeframes."

### Critical Observation: MA Cluster at $475-478
The SMA5 ($478.26), SMA20 ($478.56), and SMA50 ($475.44) have converged into a tight cluster. This is significant:

1. **After a correction**, MAs converge as the shorter-term averages catch down to the intermediate ones
2. This cluster now acts as **dynamic support** — per Shannon, "consolidations holding above rising longer-term MA often lead to significant upside moves once buyers regain control of the short-term trend"
3. A decisive break below this cluster (~$474) would be the first meaningful technical warning
4. The convergence also means a pullback to this zone would offer a low-risk entry with all MAs providing layered support

### SMA200 Gap
Price ($495) is 35% above SMA200 ($366). This is an extended gap. Per Shannon, "the further a stock travels from a valid level of support, the riskier purchases are regardless of trend maturity." However, in explosive Stage 2 moves driven by secular growth themes (AI/optical networking), extended deviations from the 200-day can persist for months.

## 3. Volume Character

### What the Charts Show

**6-month volume profile (VP):**
- **POC (Point of Control):** $447.13 — the price level with the highest traded volume over 6 months
- **Value Area High (VAH):** $518.28 — upper boundary of the 70% volume distribution
- **Value Area Low (VAL):** $371.67 — lower boundary

**1-year volume profile:**
- **POC:** $221.90 (bulk of volume traded at much lower prices)
- **VAH:** $410.04
- **VAL:** $161.31

### Volume Interpretation

1. **The 6-month VP POC at $447** tells us where the "fair value" consensus has formed over the past 6 months. Price at $495 is above the value area — this is a bullish position. Per Shannon, when price is above the POC and VAH, buyers are in control and willing to pay above consensus value.

2. **The 1-year VAH at $410** is critical — this was the ceiling of the heaviest volume zone over the full year. Price broke above $410 in November and has held above it since, even during the January correction (low ~$400). This breakout-and-hold confirms institutional accumulation at higher prices.

3. **Volume bars on the chart** show:
   - Large volume spikes during the Dec highs and the Jan correction — this is typical of the "broken stairstep" process where strong holders accumulate from weak hands during the pullback
   - The recovery from ~$400 to $495 appears to be on moderate volume — not explosive buying, but enough to sustain the move
   - Recent volume is normalizing — this is neither confirming nor rejecting the move. Per Shannon: "a stock can continue higher on low volume due to lack of supply"

4. **Earnings volume (Feb 2):** FN reported Q2 FY2026 earnings on Feb 2 — revenue +36% YoY, record EPS above guidance, strong Q3 guide ($3.45-$3.60 EPS vs $3.19 estimate). The stock closed at $499.61 then dropped to ~$460 after-hours. **It recovered to $495 by Feb 13.** This absorption of the post-earnings selloff is bullish — per Shannon, "when a stock breaks down on news but quickly recovers, it signals that the supply/demand balance still favors buyers."

### Volume Verdict: NEUTRAL-TO-BULLISH
Volume is not loudly confirming the recovery, but the absence of heavy selling during the pullback is itself bullish. The earnings selloff absorption is a positive signal. The VP structure supports the current price being above fair value consensus.

## 4. Key Support and Resistance Levels

### Resistance (Overhead Supply)

| Level | Type | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| **$500** | Psychological / round number | Minor — has been crossed multiple times |
| **$518** | 6-month VP VAH | Moderate — upper edge of value area, likely supply zone |
| **$528-531** | ATH zone (Dec high $531.22, ATH close $528.17) | **MAJOR** — all-time high, maximum potential for profit-taking supply. Per Shannon: level where "all longs are in profit and sellers have maximum motivation to lock in gains" |

### Support (Demand Zones)

| Level | Type | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| **$475-478** | MA cluster (SMA5/20/50) | **KEY** — dynamic support from converged MAs. First line of defense. A break below here changes the short-term character. |
| **$447** | 6-month VP POC | **STRONG** — highest volume node over 6 months. Represents fair value consensus. Would expect strong buying interest here. |
| **$410** | 1-year VP VAH / prior breakout level | **MAJOR** — polarity principle: prior resistance becomes support. Also the approximate level of the Jan correction low (~$400). A break below $410 would signal potential Stage 3 transition. |
| **$366** | SMA200 (rising) | **CRITICAL** — the "line in the sand" for the primary uptrend. A break below SMA200 would confirm Stage 2 is over. |

## 5. Multi-Timeframe Alignment

| Timeframe | Stage | MA Alignment | Trend Direction | Bias |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Daily** | Stage 2 (mid-to-late) | Bullish (5>20>50>200, all rising) | Up, in correction recovery | Long |
| **Weekly** (inferred) | Stage 2 (powerful) | Bullish (price well above all long-term MAs) | Strongly up | Long |

**Alignment: CONFIRMED.** Both timeframes agree — Stage 2 uptrend. Per Shannon: "the highest-probability trades come when there is alignment of trend across multiple timeframes."

**Key nuance:** The daily shows a stock that has just recovered from a correction within the larger Stage 2. Per Shannon: "short-term corrections occurring in the context of a longer-term timeframe typically will be resolved in the direction of the longer-term trend." The Jan correction resolved higher — this is exactly what the framework predicts for a healthy Stage 2.

## 6. Risk/Reward Assessment

### Scenario A: Entry NOW at $495.55

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Entry | $495.55 |
| Stop | $474 (below MA cluster at $475) |
| Risk per share | $21.55 |
| Target 1 | $531 (ATH retest) |
| Reward to T1 | $35.45 |
| **R:R to T1** | **1.65:1** |
| Target 2 | $560 (measured move from $400 base + range) |
| Reward to T2 | $64.45 |
| **R:R to T2** | **2.99:1** |

**Verdict: DOES NOT MEET 3:1 THRESHOLD at first target.** Per Shannon, "only take the trade when profit potential is sufficient relative to perceived risk (minimum 3:1 ratio)." The R:R to the ATH retest is only 1.65:1 — unacceptable for an initial entry.

### Scenario B: Entry on PULLBACK to MA cluster at $478

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Entry | $478 |
| Stop | $460 (below MA cluster with buffer) |
| Risk per share | $18 |
| Target 1 | $531 (ATH retest) |
| Reward to T1 | $53 |
| **R:R to T1** | **2.94:1** |
| Target 2 | $560 |
| Reward to T2 | $82 |
| **R:R to T2** | **4.56:1** |

**Verdict: NEAR 3:1 at first target, excellent at T2.** This is the actionable entry.

### Scenario C: Entry on DEEPER pullback to VP POC at $447

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Entry | $447 |
| Stop | $425 (below POC with buffer) |
| Risk per share | $22 |
| Target 1 | $531 (ATH) |
| Reward to T1 | $84 |
| **R:R to T1** | **3.82:1** |

**Verdict: EXCELLENT R:R.** But may never get this fill in a strong Stage 2.

## 7. Recommendation

### Stage: STAGE 2 (Markup) — Both Timeframes

### Direction: LONG

### Current Conditions: NOT YET FAVORABLE FOR NEW ENTRY

**The trade setup is right. The entry price is wrong.**

FN is in a powerful, confirmed Stage 2 uptrend with multi-timeframe alignment, rising MAs across the board, and a fundamental catalyst (sole manufacturer of NVIDIA's 1.6T optical transceivers, 36% revenue growth, beat-and-raise quarter). The secular trend is intact.

However, at $495.55:
1. **Risk/reward to first resistance ($531 ATH) is only 1.65:1** — below Shannon's 3:1 minimum
2. **Price is extended** from the MA cluster ($475-478) and VP POC ($447)
3. **Short-term momentum is neutral** — SMA5 ≈ SMA20, MACD histogram slightly negative, RSI at 54.5 (no thrust)
4. The stock has rallied ~24% off the Jan correction low (~$400) without a meaningful pause

### Action Plan

**PRIMARY (Preferred):** Set alerts at $478-480 (MA cluster). If price pulls back to this zone and forms a higher low with volume contraction (Shannon's "healthy pullback" signature), enter long with:
- Entry: ~$478
- Stop: $460 (below MA cluster)
- Target 1: $531 (ATH retest) — R:R ~3:1
- Target 2: $560+ (new ATH breakout) — R:R 4.5:1
- Position size accordingly

**SECONDARY (Aggressive):** If FN breaks above $531 on heavy volume (ATH breakout), enter on the first pullback that holds above $518 (prior VAH becomes support per polarity principle):
- Entry: ~$520
- Stop: $505 (below breakout zone)
- Target: $580-600 (measured move)
- R:R: ~4:1

**AVOID:** Chasing the current price. Per Shannon: "the further the stock has traveled from a valid level of support, the riskier purchases are."

### What Would Change This View

**Bullish escalation (Stage 2 continuation confirmed):**
- Break above $531 on volume >1.5x average = ATH breakout, enter on first pullback
- Pullback to $475-480 that holds with diminishing volume = textbook re-entry

**Bearish warning (potential Stage 3 transition):**
- Break below $475 MA cluster on heavy volume = first short-term warning
- Break below $447 VP POC = daily stage shifting toward distribution
- Break below $410 (Jan correction low / 1-year VAH) = Stage 2 is over, Stage 3 confirmed
- SMA50 flattening and rolling over = intermediate-term trend loss

## Fundamental Context (Supporting, Not Driving)

- **Revenue:** $1.13B Q2 FY2026, +36% YoY — accelerating growth
- **EPS:** Record, above guidance. Q3 guide $3.45-$3.60 vs $3.19 consensus
- **Moat:** Sole manufacturer of NVIDIA's 1.6T optical transceivers — monopolistic supply position in the AI infrastructure buildout
- **Balance sheet:** Near-zero debt (0.35% D/E), $969M cash — fortress balance sheet
- **Asset-light model:** Manufacturing services, not capital-intensive fab ownership
- **Valuation:** P/E ~40-51x (trailing) — rich by traditional metrics, but per Shannon: "traditional valuation tools (P/E ratios) become less useful as emotion overrides reason" in Stage 2. Price is the only objective measurement of value.

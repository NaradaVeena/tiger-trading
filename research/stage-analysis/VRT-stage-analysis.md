## 1. Stage Identification

### Weekly Timeframe — Stage 2 (Markup), Mid-to-Late Phase

The weekly chart over 2 years tells a powerful story. VRT ran from ~$63 to a first peak near $150 (early-mid 2024), then underwent a deep correction back to the $75–80 zone — a classic Stage 2 correction, not a Stage 4 decline, because the 200-week SMA (orange, ~$86) held as support and maintained its positive slope throughout. That correction was a "broken stairstep" within the larger uptrend.

From the mid-2025 lows (~$75–80), the stock rebuilt through a Stage 1 accumulation base and broke out again, resuming Stage 2. The current weekly structure shows:

- **Price pattern:** Higher highs and higher lows since mid-2025. Staircase from lower-left to upper-right.
- **MA alignment:** SMA5 ($195) > SMA20 ($178) > SMA50 ($138) > SMA200 (~$86) — **textbook Stage 2 bullish stacking, all rising.**
- **RSI:** 72.4 — overbought territory, consistent with a strong Stage 2 thrust but warns of near-term exhaustion.
- **MACD:** 16.3 vs signal 13.3, histogram positive and expanding — momentum confirming.

**Weekly verdict: Stage 2 uptrend, but extended. The thrust from ~$160 to $255 has been aggressive and RSI is overbought. This is mid-to-late in the current weekly markup leg.**

### Daily Timeframe — Stage 2 (Markup), Parabolic Extension

The daily chart over 6 months shows the most recent campaign in vivid detail:

- VRT traded sideways in a $118–$160 range (Aug–Oct 2025), then broke out above the VAH at $196 in late January 2026.
- From early February, the stock went near-vertical: $196 → $255 high → $234.53 current.
- **MA alignment:** SMA5 ($224) > SMA20 ($195) > SMA50 ($180) — **bullish stacking, all rising steeply.**
- **RSI:** 69.4 — just below overbought, pulling back from higher levels.
- **MACD:** 14.0 vs signal 8.7, histogram strongly positive — momentum is accelerating.

**Daily verdict: Stage 2, but in a parabolic extension phase. The stock has rocketed ~50% above its 50-day SMA. Shannon warns that "greed-driven fast rallies should alert you to monitor short-term charts closely — these stocks can decline faster than they rallied."**

## 2. Moving Average Alignment & Slopes

| MA | Daily Value | Weekly Value | Slope | Interpretation |
|----|------------|-------------|-------|---------------|
| SMA5 | $224.23 | $195.14 | Steeply rising | Short-term buyers aggressive |
| SMA20 | $194.99 | $178.25 | Rising | Intermediate trend solidly bullish |
| SMA50 | $179.76 | $137.91 | Rising | Primary trend bullish |
| SMA200 | ~$160 (est) | ~$86 (est) | Rising | Long-term secular uptrend intact |

**Key observation:** Price is trading 30% above the daily 20 SMA and 31% above the daily 50 SMA. This degree of extension is unsustainable short-term. Per Shannon: "The further a stock travels from a valid level of support, the riskier purchases are regardless of trend maturity."

The MA alignment is unambiguously bullish across all timeframes. The problem isn't direction — it's **distance from mean.** The rubber band is stretched.

## 3. Volume Character

### Daily Volume Assessment
- The breakout above $196 (VAH) in late January occurred on **expanding volume** — healthy, confirming demand.
- The subsequent parabolic run to $255 showed **large volume spikes**, particularly on the biggest up-days.
- However, the most recent sessions show **extremely large volume at highs** — Shannon flags this: "Big volume without further price progress in trend direction = distribution signal" and "Large volume after extended trending often signals exhaustion and turning point."
- The last candle at $234.53 is a red candle on high volume after hitting $255 — a potential **exhaustion signal**.

### Weekly Volume Assessment
- Volume has expanded on the rally weeks — **confirming** the Stage 2 uptrend direction.
- Recent weeks show the heaviest volume in months — this is characteristic of late-stage euphoric buying.

**Volume verdict: Confirming the trend direction (up) but flashing late-cycle warnings. Heavy volume at highs after an extended run often precedes a correction. Not bearish yet, but suggests the easy money has been made in this leg.**

## 4. Key Support & Resistance Levels

### From Volume Profile Data

| Level | Type | Significance |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **$255** | Resistance | Recent high / potential blow-off top |
| **$196** | Support (former resistance) | Daily VAH — polarity flip. Key breakout level. First line of defense. |
| **$179–180** | Support | Daily SMA50, prior consolidation area |
| **$161** | Support | Daily VP POC — highest volume node over 6 months. Major support. |
| **$148** | Support | Daily VAL — lower boundary of the value area |
| **$131** | Support | Weekly VAH — significant longer-term level |
| **$86** | Support | Weekly VP POC / approximate 200-week SMA — secular floor |

### Anchored VWAP Context
- 6-month VWAP: $167.91 — stock is 40% above its average cost basis over this period. Buyers from the last 6 months are well in profit.
- 2-year VWAP: $112.08 — longer-term holders deeply profitable, reducing urgency to sell but also reducing willingness to chase at $234.

**Critical level for any pullback entry:** The $196 breakout level (daily VAH) is the pivotal polarity flip. If VRT can pull back to $196–$200 and hold, that would be the highest-probability re-entry zone.

## 5. Multi-Timeframe Alignment

| Timeframe | Stage | Trend | MA Alignment | Bias |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------------|------|
| Weekly | Stage 2 (mid-late) | Up | Bullish stacking, all rising | Long |
| Daily | Stage 2 (parabolic) | Up | Bullish stacking, all rising | Long but extended |

**Alignment: Fully aligned bullish.** Both timeframes confirm Stage 2 uptrend. This is the condition Shannon describes as "highest-probability" for long trades — when the primary (weekly) and tactical (daily) timeframes agree.

**However**, alignment doesn't mean "buy anywhere." The extension from moving averages on both timeframes is extreme. RSI is overbought on weekly (72.4) and near overbought on daily (69.4). Shannon is clear: "The further a stock has traveled from a valid level of support, the riskier purchases are."

**The trend is unambiguously up. The entry timing is poor at current levels.**

## 7. Recommendation

### WAIT — Do Not Chase. Stalk the Pullback.

**The trend is your friend. The price is not.**

VRT is in a powerful Stage 2 uptrend across all timeframes with textbook bullish MA alignment. The secular thesis (DC power/cooling, $15B backlog, AI infrastructure buildout) supports continued upside over quarters. This is a stock you want to own.

But **not here, not now.** The stock is:
- 30%+ above its 20-day and 50-day moving averages
- RSI overbought on the weekly timeframe
- Showing potential exhaustion volume (huge volume, red candle off $255 highs)
- Offering only 1.2:1 R/R from current levels — Shannon's framework requires 3:1 minimum

### Action Plan

1. **Alert at $196–$200** — First pullback zone. Former resistance (VAH) becomes support. Wait for a higher low to form on the daily, then enter on first higher high. R/R approaches ~2.5:1.

2. **Alert at $175–$180** — Dream entry. SMA50 confluence with prior consolidation zone. If the stock pulls back here and the weekly structure holds (higher low above the mid-2025 ~$150 range), this is a 3.4:1 setup and an aggressive buy.

3. **Invalidation below $158** — If VRT breaks below the VP POC at $161, the Stage 2 structure on the daily timeframe is in question. Reassess entirely.

4. **If you must act now** — Use a small pilot position (¼ size) with a stop at $210 (below the recent gap area). Accept the poor R/R as a "participation" position and plan to add on a pullback to better levels.

### Key Watchpoints
- **Earnings date** — Any upcoming earnings could be the catalyst for either continuation or the correction needed to create a better entry.
- **Volume on pullback** — If VRT pulls back on *diminishing* volume to the $196–$200 zone, that's the healthy Stage 2 "broken stairstep" pattern. If volume expands on the decline, question the trend.
- **Weekly SMA20 ($178)** — This rising MA is the weekly trend's backbone. As long as price holds above it on a closing basis, the Stage 2 uptrend is intact.

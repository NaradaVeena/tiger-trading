## 📊 Final Rankings

### #1 — NVT (nVent Electric) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Market Cap** | ~$18.2B |
| **Price** | ~$112.65 |
| **One-Line Thesis** | AI data center cooling & infrastructure with NVIDIA partnership and $2.3B backlog |
| **Key Metric** | Revenue +30% YoY, Data Center revenue $1.0B (+67% YoY), FY2026E EPS $4.00-$4.15 (+22% YoY) |
| **Hidden Gem Score** | **8/10** |
| **Forward P/E** | ~28x |
| **Verdict** | **BUY** ✅ |

**Rationale:** Best risk-reward in the group. Reasonable valuation (~28x forward P/E) for 20%+ EPS growth. Deep NVIDIA liquid cooling partnership. $2.3B record backlog (tripled YoY) provides exceptional visibility. Infrastructure exposure shifting to 50%+ data center. Technical setup is neutral/constructive — not overbought. This is the kind of stock you build a position in.

---

### #2 — FN (Fabrinet) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Market Cap** | ~$18.5B |
| **Price** | ~$500.57 |
| **One-Line Thesis** | The "Foxconn of Photonics" — sole manufacturer of 1.6T transceivers for NVIDIA Blackwell |
| **Key Metric** | Revenue +35% YoY guidance, 100% market share on 1.6T transceivers, 10%+ operating margins |
| **Hidden Gem Score** | **8/10** |
| **Forward P/E** | ~30-32x |
| **Verdict** | **BUY** ✅ |

**Rationale:** Strongest moat in the group — sole qualified manufacturer for next-gen optical transceivers. Asset-light model means whoever wins the component war, FN wins. Building 10 expansion pre-sold. Moving into CPO and OCS (next-gen architectures). Management executing flawlessly with consecutive beats. Neutral RSI (55.4) means it's not overextended. Buy on any pullback to $450-470.

### #3 — COHR (Coherent Corp) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐½
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Market Cap** | ~$34B |
| **Price** | ~$219.66 |
| **One-Line Thesis** | Vertically integrated optical transceiver leader with 4x book-to-bill and InP cost advantage |
| **Key Metric** | Data Center revenue +33.6% YoY, 4x book-to-bill ratio, calendar 2026 fully booked |
| **Hidden Gem Score** | **7.5/10** |
| **Forward P/E** | ~45x |
| **Verdict** | **BUY** ✅ (on pullbacks to $200-210) |

**Rationale:** Best demand visibility of any stock analyzed — 4x book-to-bill with 2026 booked and 2027 filling. Vertical integration in indium phosphide lasers gives structural cost advantage. OCS and CPO product cycles create new multi-billion dollar revenue streams. At 45x forward P/E, it's not cheap, but the visibility justifies a premium. Accumulate on pullbacks rather than chase.

---

### #4 — ALAB (Astera Labs) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Market Cap** | ~$22.4B |
| **Price** | ~$132.32 |
| **One-Line Thesis** | Purpose-built AI connectivity silicon (PCIe/CXL/Ethernet) solving the interconnect bottleneck |
| **Key Metric** | Revenue +115% YoY, 74% gross margins, Amazon strategic warrant ($466M) |
| **Hidden Gem Score** | **7/10** |
| **Forward P/E** | ~60-70x |
| **Verdict** | **WATCH** 👀 (accumulate if stabilizes at $120-130) |

**Rationale:** Fastest growth in the group (115% YoY) with exceptional gross margins (74%) indicating genuine differentiation. Amazon warrant signals deepening hyperscaler relationship. Scorpio fabric switch is a potentially massive product cycle. BUT — the stock is in a severe downtrend (down 50% from highs), the CFO just departed, and 26x P/S is still rich. Wait for technical stabilization. High conviction idea for 2-3 year holders willing to stomach volatility.

---

### #5 — PWR (Quanta Services) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Market Cap** | ~$77B |
| **Price** | ~$524.36 |
| **One-Line Thesis** | Largest electrical contractor in N. America — indispensable for AI grid buildout |
| **Key Metric** | Revenue $27.2B TTM (+17.6% YoY), $39.2B record backlog, 68,000 craft-skilled workers |
| **Hidden Gem Score** | **5/10** |
| **Forward P/E** | ~38-42x |
| **Verdict** | **WATCH** 👀 (buy on pullback to $430-460) |

**Rationale:** Arguably the strongest moat of any stock analyzed — 68,000 skilled workers is unreplicable. $39.2B backlog provides years of visibility. NiSource 3GW deal shows expanding into generation. Multi-decade infrastructure supercycle with multiple drivers (AI, EVs, renewables, aging grid). However, at 76x trailing P/E it's priced like a growth tech company, not a construction firm. Earnings on Feb 19 are the next catalyst. Best entry on a pullback.

---

### #6 — CRDO (Credo Technology) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Market Cap** | ~$20B |
| **Price** | ~$121.34 |
| **One-Line Thesis** | 88% market share in Active Electrical Cables solving the "copper wall" in AI clusters |
| **Key Metric** | Revenue +173% YoY FY2026E, prelim Q3 rev $404-408M (18-20% beat), 67.7% gross margins |
| **Hidden Gem Score** | **6/10** |
| **Forward P/E** | ~50-60x |
| **Verdict** | **WATCH** 👀 (buy if 200-day SMA holds at $122) |

**Rationale:** Dominant market share (88% AEC) and massive revenue growth (173% FY26E) make this one of the highest-upside plays. But very high customer concentration (Microsoft), uncertain copper vs. optical debate for short-reach connections, and expected growth deceleration to ~40% in FY27. The 200-day SMA at $122 is the key technical level. If it holds, attractive risk/reward. If it breaks, wait for $100-105.

---

### #7 — MOD (Modine Manufacturing) ⭐⭐⭐⭐
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Market Cap** | ~$7.4B |
| **Price** | ~$219.96 |
| **One-Line Thesis** | 100-year-old company transformed into pure-play AI data center cooling via Gentherm spinoff |
| **Key Metric** | Data center revenue +78% YoY, Climate Solutions +21% organic growth, Gentherm spinoff in progress |
| **Hidden Gem Score** | **6/10** |
| **Forward P/E** | ~35-40x |
| **Verdict** | **WATCH** 👀 (wait for pullback to $170-180) |

**Rationale:** The transformation story is compelling — spinning off legacy auto/industrial to become pure-play data center cooling. 78% data center revenue growth is exceptional. But the stock is EXTREMELY overbought (RSI 82, 41% above 50-day SMA) after doubling in 3 months. The Gentherm spinoff is a real catalyst but the parabolic move has priced in years of execution. Wait for a healthy pullback before entering.

### #8 — GLW (Corning Incorporated) ⭐⭐⭐⭐
| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Market Cap** | ~$115B |
| **Price** | ~$131.74 |
| **One-Line Thesis** | World's dominant fiber optics supplier riding AI data center interconnect demand |
| **Key Metric** | Optical Comms +24% YoY (Enterprise +93%), Meta $6B deal, FY25 core EPS +29% |
| **Hidden Gem Score** | **4/10** |
| **Forward P/E** | ~42x |
| **Verdict** | **WATCH** 👀 (wait for pullback to $100-110) |

**Rationale:** Excellent company with genuine competitive advantages in fiber optics. The Meta $6B deal validates the AI thesis and Springboard plan upgrade to $11B is bullish. But at 72x trailing P/E and 50% YTD rally, the stock is the most "priced to perfection" in the group. 6th best performer in the S&P 500 year-to-date — this is no longer a hidden gem by any definition. Insider selling is picking up. Wait for a meaningful pullback before committing capital.

## Key Themes Across All 8 Stocks

1. **Valuations are universally stretched.** Every stock in this group trades at a significant premium to historical averages. The AI infrastructure theme is well-recognized by the market.

2. **Backlogs and order books are exceptional.** NVT ($2.3B), PWR ($39.2B), COHR (4x B2B), FN (pre-sold capacity) — demand visibility is the best it's been in the data center cycle.

3. **The strongest moats are labor and manufacturing.** FN (sole 1.6T manufacturer), PWR (68K workers), COHR (InP vertical integration) — these advantages take years to replicate.

4. **The smartest money is being patient.** The best entries come on pullbacks, not breakouts. Every stock in this list has had 10-20% drawdowns even during the AI mega-rally.

5. **Diversification across the stack reduces single-point risk.** If optical wins over copper (bad for CRDO, good for FN/COHR), or if grid buildout slows (bad for PWR, fine for NVT), a diversified basket captures the overall trend.

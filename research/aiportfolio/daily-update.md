### Detailed Analysis

#### 🥇 ANET — Best Setup (Near-PROPOSE)
- **Only ticker to pass Gate 2** (5 pass + 1 conditional, 0 fails)
- Full bullish MA stack, 13.2% extension (normal), within VP value area
- R/R at current $141.59 = 2.4:1 (conditional, not 3:1)
- **Entry zone:** Pullback to $135-138 → R/R = 4.1:1 ✅
- Support: SMA20 $138, SMA50 $133, POC $130 | Resistance: VAH $149, prior high $165

#### 🥈 TSEM — Best Thesis, Needs Pullback
- Strong fundamental (NVIDIA SiPho partnership, $920M CapEx)
- 69% extension above SMA200 = extreme | R/R at current = 2.38:1
- **Entry zone:** POC $121 → R/R = 4.67:1 ✅
- Support: POC $121, SMA50 $125 | Resistance: SMA20 $133, prior high $150

#### NVT — Consolidating at POC
- Sitting right at POC $112.36 (thick support)
- R/R doesn't work at current price (1.48:1)
- **Entry zone:** $103-105 (VWAP) or breakout above $121

#### FN — Above Entry Zone
- RULES.md entry zone $440-470, current $496 is above
- R/R at current = 1.67:1
- **Entry zone:** Pullback to $447-460 (POC) → R/R = 3.04:1 ✅

#### CRDO — Stage 4 Decline Despite Strong Fundamentals
- Revenue +272% YoY, pre-announced massive beat
- Chart broken: below all short-term MAs, approaching death cross
- **Wait for:** Base above $128 (VAL), SMA20 turn up

#### ALAB — Stage 4 Decline, Post-Earnings Selloff
- Down ~24% despite revenue beat (margin compression concern)
- Below SMA200 ($149), inverted MA stack
- **Wait for:** Reclaim $149 (SMA200) with volume

#### COHR & PWR — Weakened Thesis, No Entry
- Both need thesis promotion + significant pullbacks

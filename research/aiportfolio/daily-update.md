### Open Positions
| Ticker | Shares | Avg Cost | Price | P&L | P&L% | Regime |
|--------|--------|----------|-------|-----|------|--------|
| ANET | 35 | $143.58 | $136.12 | -$261 | -5.2% | Chop 🔄 |
| COHR | 16 | $245.78 | $247.37 | +$25 | +0.6% | Goldilocks 🎯 |
| PWR | 7 | $555.40 | $555.56 | +$1 | +0.0% | Goldilocks 🎯 |

**Notes:**
- **ANET:** Down -5.2%. Stop at $120. Regime is **Chop** (MeanRev 82% accurate), suggesting the dip to support ($127 VP VAL) is a buying opportunity, not a sell signal.
- **COHR & PWR:** Both entered today. Both in **Goldilocks** regime (Trend > 60%, MeanRev > 55%). This confirms the timing — we are buying leaders where both trend and support/resistance signals are working.

### Regime Scan (New Data)
Significant shifts detected in today's scan:

| Ticker | Regime | Trend Acc | MeanRev Acc | Change |
|--------|--------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **COHR** | **Goldilocks 🎯** | 60% | 76% | Trending -> Goldilocks |
| **PWR** | **Goldilocks 🎯** | 90% | 56% | Trending -> Goldilocks |
| **GLW** | **Trending ✅** | 83% | 38% | Mixed -> Trending |
| **VRT** | **Trending ✅** | 67% | 48% | Mixed -> Trending |
| **ANET** | **Chop 🔄** | 29% | 82% | — |
| **NVT** | **Chop 🔄** | 42% | 78% | — |
| **ALAB** | **Mixed** | 20% | 58% | Chop -> Mixed |
| **TSEM** | **Mixed** | 51% | 68% | Goldilocks -> Mixed |

**Implications:**
1. **GLW & VRT** have entered **Trending** mode. We should look for pullbacks to MA support (Gate 2) to enter.
2. **ANET** is deeply in **Chop**. Breakouts will fail. Buy support/sell resistance. Our entry was arguably early, but the regime says "hold for rotation," not "panic sell."
3. **LITE** (Mixed) has an 88% Trend score but 50% MeanRev. It's effectively Trending but failing the strict definition.

## Per-Ticker Developments This Week

### ✅ **ALAB** - Mixed Earnings Signal
**Event:** Q4 2025 earnings reported Feb 10
- **Revenue:** $270.6M (+17% QoQ, +92% YoY)
- **Full Year:** $852.5M (+115% YoY)
- **Miss:** Analysts expected >$280M
- **Net Income:** $45M (+82% YoY)

**Thesis Impact:** **NEUTRAL** - Growth trajectory intact but slight deceleration. The +92% YoY growth confirms hypergrowth thesis, but the modest revenue miss suggests slowing momentum. Still validating core thesis but entry timing remains patient.

### 🚀 **CRDO** - Blowout Guidance Raise
**Event:** Preliminary Q3 guidance pre-announcement
- **Q3 Revenue:** $404-408M vs. prior guidance of $335-345M (**20%+ beat**)
- **FY26 Outlook:** >200% YoY growth to $1.3B
- **Accelerating Growth:** Confirms AI infrastructure scaling thesis

**Thesis Impact:** **STRENGTHENED** - This is the strongest development of the week. Massive guidance beat validates the thesis that AEC demand is accelerating with AI cluster buildouts. Customer diversification (5th hyperscaler ramping) reducing concentration risk.

### 📈 **FN** - Solid Beat and Momentum
**Event:** Earnings beat with strong day-after performance
- **EPS:** $3.36 vs. $3.26 expected (+$0.10 beat)
- **Revenue:** $1.13B vs. $1.08B expected
- **Stock Performance:** +7.25% day-after, +10% over 7 days

**Thesis Impact:** **STRENGTHENED** - Confirms NVIDIA relationship deepening as self-production scales. The beat validates the toll-booth manufacturing model thesis.

### 🔥 **NVT** - Backlog Explosion Continues
**Event:** Strong 2025 results with acquisition pipeline confidence
- **Q4 Sales:** $1.07B
- **Full Year:** $3.89B
- **Backlog:** $2.3B (3x YoY growth confirmed)
- **Stock:** +8.8% over 90 days, +67.43% over 1 year
- **Price Target:** $126.25 (currently $113.25)

**Thesis Impact:** **STRENGTHENED** - The backlog tripling confirms secular data center cooling demand. Cleanest risk profile in the portfolio with no single customer >12%.

### ⚠️ **COHR** - Earnings Quality Concerns
**Event:** Q2 FY26 earnings with mixed reception
- **Revenue:** $1.69B
- **Net Income:** $146.72M
- **Guidance:** Q3 $1.70-1.84B
- **Stock:** +6.0% but analyst concerns about earnings quality

**Thesis Impact:** **NEUTRAL/WEAK** - While topline numbers look decent, concerns about earnings foundations align with our Watch/Weakened classification. Thin chart structure above $121 remains a technical concern.

### 🏔️ **PWR** - New Highs, Valuation Stretched
**Event:** Hit record high of $502.54 on Feb 6
- **Performance:** +60% over past year, +20% YTD 2026
- **Catalyst:** Baron Durable Advantage Fund highlighted in Q4 letter
- **Upcoming:** Earnings scheduled for Feb 20 (Thursday)

**Thesis Impact:** **NEUTRAL/WEAK** - Great business hitting new highs validates our thesis quality, but valuation is now extreme. This reinforces our Watch/Weakened classification - right company, wrong price.

## Thesis Status Changes

**No changes to core thesis classifications this week.**

All thesis-strengthening developments (CRDO guidance explosion, FN beats, NVT backlog confirmation) align with our original investment hypotheses. The thesis-weakening signals (ALAB slight miss, COHR quality concerns, PWR valuation stretch) confirm our cautious approach on entries.

## Lessons Learned This Week

1. **Earnings Season Validation:** 4 of 6 companies reported strong results, confirming the AI infrastructure thesis is playing out as expected.

2. **CRDO's Guidance Explosion:** The 20%+ guidance beat demonstrates how hyperscaler AEC demand can accelerate rapidly - validates the "hockey stick" growth thesis for AI connectivity.

3. **Entry Point Patience Rewarded:** Remaining in cash while companies hit new highs (PWR) and maintain rich valuations has prevented buying at peaks.

4. **Customer Diversification Matters:** CRDO's 5th hyperscaler ramp and NVT's <12% max customer concentration provide stability vs single-customer dependencies.

## Outlook for Next Week (Feb 16-23, 2026)

### Key Events to Watch:
- **Feb 20 (Thu):** PWR earnings - Test of valuation vs execution at 76x P/E
- **Technical Levels:** NVT testing $115-121 resistance, COHR thin structure above $121
- **CRDO Momentum:** Watch for continued strength following guidance raise

### Entry Strategy:
- **Active Monitoring:** All 6 tickers remain on watchlist
- **Core Focus:** ALAB, CRDO, FN, NVT for any pullback opportunities
- **Patience on Watch Names:** COHR, PWR need better risk/reward setups

### Risk Factors:
- AI capex cycle turn (macro concern)
- Valuation compression across growth names
- CRDO guidance execution risk after massive raise

---

**Overall Assessment:** Strong thesis validation week with 4 earnings beats and CRDO's explosive guidance raise. Portfolio remains disciplined in cash while thesis plays out as expected. Patient approach to entries continues.

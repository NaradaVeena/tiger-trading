# Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) Industry Report
### Prepared for Monty (Piyush Gupta) — Affirm Interview Prep
**February 16, 2026 | Compiled by Narada**

## Executive Summary

BNPL has evolved from a niche checkout option to a $100B+ U.S. market reshaping consumer credit. Affirm is the fastest-growing pure-play BNPL provider, riding exclusive partnerships with Amazon, Shopify, and Apple Pay to 30% YoY revenue growth. The regulatory environment just shifted dramatically in Affirm's favor — the CFPB rescinded its Biden-era rule that would have treated BNPL like credit cards. Meanwhile, Klarna's IPO (Sep 2025, ~$14B valuation) validated the sector. Affirm trades at ~$50/share ($16-18B market cap) with a path to sustained profitability.

## 1. Market Size & Growth

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **U.S. BNPL market (2025)** | $107.4 billion | GlobeNewswire (Feb 2026) |
| **U.S. BNPL projected (2031)** | $258.4 billion | GlobeNewswire (Feb 2026) |
| **U.S. CAGR (2026-2031)** | ~15.1% | GlobeNewswire |
| **Global BNPL transactions (2025)** | ~$560 billion | Chargeflow |
| **Global BNPL users** | ~900 million by 2027 | Chargeflow |
| **U.S. historical CAGR (2022-2025)** | 23.8% | GlobeNewswire |

**Key insight:** The U.S. market is decelerating from hypergrowth (24% CAGR) to still-strong mature growth (15% CAGR). The land grab phase is ending — what matters now is unit economics, not just GMV.

### Who Uses BNPL?
- **41% of 16-24 year olds** use BNPL (Morgan Stanley)
- UK adults 55-64 adoption jumped from 10% → 21% in one year — proving it's not just a Gen Z fad
- Repeat usage is the real driver: consumers who try BNPL once tend to keep using it

## 2. Competitive Landscape

### The Big Four

| Company | Revenue (CY2024) | Active Users | GMV | Market Cap | Key Differentiator |
|---------|------------------|--------------|-----|------------|-------------------|
| **Affirm** | ~$2.6B | 21M+ | ~$30B (FY H1) | ~$17B | Longest loan terms, highest-AOV, merchant integration |
| **Klarna** | ~$2.5B | 90M+ | ~$100B+ | ~$14B (IPO) | Global scale, super-app, AI customer service |
| **Afterpay (Block)** | ~$2.5B | ~25M | — | Part of Block ($40B) | Ecosystem play (Cash App + Square) |
| **PayPal Pay in 4** | — | 400M+ PayPal users | — | Part of PayPal ($70B) | Installed base, brand trust |

### Revenue Growth (CY2024)
- **Affirm: 46%** ← fastest
- Afterpay: 25%
- Klarna: 24%

*Source: Affirm investor relations (March 2025)*

### Affirm's Competitive Position
Affirm is the **#1 or #2 BNPL provider in the U.S.** (depending on metric used), and the **fastest-growing** of the major players. Globally, Klarna dominates by user count, but in the U.S., Affirm and Afterpay have higher market share.

### New Entrants & Threats
- **Banks are entering:** Chase, Citi, U.S. Bank (Avvance) offering installment plans
- **Apple Pay Later discontinued (2024)** — Apple pivoted to enabling bank-issued BNPL through Apple Pay instead, which actually *benefits* Affirm (they're integrated into Apple Pay)
- **Embedded BNPL:** Banking-as-a-Platform (BaaS) trend in 2026 — BNPL becoming table-stakes feature in wallets and banking apps

## 3. Affirm Deep Dive

### Latest Financials (FQ2 2026, ended Dec 31, 2025)

| Metric | FQ2 2026 | YoY Change |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Revenue** | $1.12 billion | **+30%** |
| **GMV** | $13.8 billion | **+36%** |
| **EPS** | $0.37 | Beat estimate of $0.27 |
| **Active consumers** | 21M+ | Growing |
| **Active merchants** | 292,000+ | Growing |

### Full-Year Guidance (FY2026, ending June 2026)
- **Revenue:** $4.09B - $4.15B (+25-26% YoY)
- **Adjusted Operating Margin:** 27.4% - 28.1%
- **Weighted avg shares outstanding:** 351M

### Affirm Card (Physical Debit Card)
- **GMV up 159% YoY** — fastest-growing product line
- Positions Affirm for in-store/offline BNPL (not just e-commerce)
- Bridges gap between BNPL and traditional debit/credit cards

### Strategic Partnerships — The Moat

| Partner | Relationship | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Amazon** | Exclusive BNPL at checkout | 41% of U.S. e-commerce. Massive distribution. |
| **Shopify** | Powers Shop Pay Installments (exclusive) | 10%+ of U.S. SMB commerce, expanding globally (UK launched Dec 2025) |
| **Apple Pay** | Integrated BNPL provider | Apple killed its own Pay Later → partnered with Affirm instead. Validation. |
| **Walmart** | Checkout integration | Largest U.S. retailer |
| **Target** | Checkout integration | Top-10 U.S. retailer |

**Nearly 90% of top U.S. e-commerce brands** use Affirm as their BNPL provider.

### Revenue Model
Affirm makes money three ways:
1. **Merchant fees** (3-8% of transaction) — merchants pay because BNPL increases AOV and conversion
2. **Consumer interest** (on longer-term loans, 0-36% APR) — Affirm is unique in offering 6-60 month terms
3. **Network revenue** (Affirm Card transactions, interchange)

**Key differentiator:** Affirm **never charges late fees**. This is central to the brand identity and regulatory positioning. Revenue comes from transparent interest rates, not hidden penalties.

### Stock Profile
- **Ticker:** AFRM (NASDAQ)
- **Price:** ~$50 (as of Feb 15, 2026)
- **Market Cap:** ~$16-18B
- **52-week range:** ~$25 - $82
- **Analyst targets:** Mizuho recently cut to $95 from $114 (still ~90% upside from current price)
- **P/E:** ~61x (recently turned GAAP profitable)

## 4. Regulatory Landscape — Major Tailwind for Affirm

### The CFPB Reversal (2025) — This Is Big

**Timeline:**
1. **May 2024:** Biden-era CFPB issued interpretive rule classifying BNPL providers as "card issuers" under Regulation Z (Truth in Lending Act)
   - Would have required: billing statements, dispute rights, unauthorized use protections, advertising disclosures
   - This was an existential compliance burden for BNPL providers
2. **March 2025:** Trump-era CFPB signaled it would rescind the rule
3. **June 2025:** CFPB confirmed it **will not issue any revised BNPL rule**
4. **Current state:** BNPL operates in a **lighter regulatory environment** than credit cards

**What this means for Affirm:**
- No mandatory Reg Z compliance overhead
- Competitive advantage vs. credit cards (which bear full regulatory burden)
- More freedom to innovate on product design
- Reduced compliance costs

### State-Level Activity
- States may still pursue their own BNPL regulations
- California, New York, and others have explored disclosure requirements
- Affirm proactively provides disclosures — positions them well regardless

### Credit Reporting
- BNPL loans are still not consistently reported to credit bureaus
- This is both a risk (hidden debt) and an advantage (no credit score impact for consumers)
- Industry moving toward voluntary reporting — Affirm has been a leader here

---

## 5. Risk Factors & Challenges

### Credit Risk
- **BNPL delinquency rate: ~2%** (vs. credit cards at ~8.8%) — per Richmond Fed, FTA data
- **Default rate: below 3%** (vs. credit cards ~10%) — per CFPB data (2019-2022)
- **BUT:** 41% of BNPL users report making at least one late payment
- **Rising concern:** 24% increase in BNPL delinquency rates as market grows — still low in absolute terms but trending up
- Affirm's 30+ day delinquency rates are **lower than major credit card issuers**

### Macro Sensitivity
- BNPL usage increases during economic stress (consumers need flexibility)
- But credit quality deteriorates during downturns
- Affirm's underwriting model (proprietary ML) is untested through a severe recession

### Competitive Threats
1. **Bank BNPL:** Chase, Citi embedding installment plans into existing cards — zero customer acquisition cost
2. **Apple's pivot:** While Apple Pay Later failed, Apple enabling bank-issued BNPL creates new competitive dynamics
3. **Klarna's IPO war chest:** ~$1.3B raised, will invest in U.S. market share
4. **Margin pressure:** As BNPL becomes table-stakes, merchant fees could compress

### Profitability Questions
- Affirm only recently turned profitable (GAAP EPS positive)
- Path to sustained profitability depends on:
  - Scaling Affirm Card (higher-margin, more frequent transactions)
  - International expansion via Shopify
  - Maintaining merchant fee rates as competition increases

---

## 6. Industry Trends to Watch (2026-2028)

### 1. Embedded BNPL Everywhere
BNPL is becoming a feature, not a product. Banks, wallets, and platforms all offering it. Winners will be those with the best underwriting and merchant relationships — Affirm's advantage.

### 2. Offline/In-Store Expansion
The Affirm Card is the key play here. Online BNPL is mature; in-store is still underpenetrated. The card bridges both worlds.

### 3. International Expansion
Affirm is going global via Shopify — UK launched Dec 2025. Global expansion could be a major growth driver but also brings currency risk and local regulatory complexity.

### 4. AI-Driven Underwriting
All BNPL providers are investing in ML/AI for credit decisioning. Affirm's proprietary models are a moat — they process vast transaction data to approve/decline in milliseconds.

### 5. Super-App Ambitions
Klarna is building a shopping super-app (price comparison, wishlists, AI assistant). Affirm is more focused on being the payments infrastructure layer. Different strategies, both viable.

### 6. B2B BNPL
Nascent but growing — installment payments for business purchases. Could be Affirm's next frontier.

## 7. Affirm-Specific Interview Talking Points

### Why Affirm Wins
1. **Distribution moat:** Amazon + Shopify + Apple Pay = access to 60%+ of U.S. e-commerce
2. **No late fees philosophy:** Regulatory positioning + brand trust + ethical differentiation
3. **Longest loan terms in industry:** 6-60 months (Klarna/Afterpay mostly 4 installments)
4. **Revenue diversification:** Merchant fees + interest + network revenue (Affirm Card)
5. **Fastest revenue growth** among BNPL peers (46% CY2024 vs. 24-25% for peers)

### What to Probe in Interviews
- How does Affirm's underwriting model handle a recession? (Untested at scale)
- What's the Affirm Card penetration target? (This is the key to in-store BNPL)
- How does Affirm maintain merchant fee rates as banks enter BNPL? (Pricing power question)
- International roadmap beyond UK/Shopify?
- Path to consistent GAAP profitability — what margin structure at maturity?

### Industry Knowledge That Impresses
- "Apple killed Pay Later and partnered with Affirm instead — that's the strongest competitive validation possible"
- "BNPL delinquency is 2% vs. credit card 8.8% — the risk narrative is overblown relative to data"
- "The CFPB rescission means BNPL has structural regulatory advantages over credit cards for the foreseeable future"
- "Affirm Card GMV up 159% — the offline opportunity is just starting"

# 2. The Pitch

## a) 30-Second Elevator Pitch
*(For LinkedIn messages or brief intros — under 300 words)*

> A&CE delivers AI-native engineering analytics for offshore energy. We've built 704+ production Python modules that automate OrcaFlex/AQWA workflows, fatigue assessment, and structural analysis — cutting typical analysis time by 60-80%.
>
> Our library includes 221 S-N curves from 17 international standards, ML-enhanced fatigue assessment (85% time reduction, 23% accuracy improvement), and batch automation that processes 50 configurations in 4 hours instead of 50.
>
> We're looking for an engineering firm that wants to own this capability — not just license it. Interested in a conversation?

## b) 2-Minute Pitch
*(For email or longer LinkedIn messages)*

> **A&CE: AI-Native Engineering Insights & Analytics for Offshore Energy**
>
> We've spent years building what most offshore engineering firms say they want but can't seem to build in-house: a production-grade, AI-powered engineering automation platform.
>
> **What we've built:**
> - **704+ production Python modules** covering structural analysis, fatigue assessment, hydrodynamics, and field economics
> - **221 S-N curves from 17 international standards** (DNV, API, ABS, BSI, and more) — the most comprehensive open library in the industry
> - **OrcaFlex/AQWA batch automation** — 50 configurations processed in 4 hours vs. 50 hours manually
> - **ML-enhanced fatigue assessment** — 85% time reduction with 23% accuracy improvement over conventional methods

### A&CE — AI-Native Engineering Insights & Analytics for Offshore Energy

**aceengineer.com**

#### The Opportunity

The offshore energy industry faces a critical productivity gap. Engineering analysis workflows — fatigue assessment, hydrodynamic modeling, structural integrity evaluation — remain largely manual, repetitive, and time-intensive. Firms investing in digital transformation typically spend 2-3 years and millions to build internal tools that deliver incremental improvements. A&CE offers a shortcut.

#### What A&CE Has Built

A&CE is a production-grade engineering analytics platform purpose-built for offshore energy:

| Capability | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Codebase** | 704+ production Python modules |
| **S-N Curve Library** | 221 curves from 17 international standards (DNV, API, ABS, BSI, IIW, etc.) |
| **Analysis Automation** | OrcaFlex & AQWA batch processing — 50 configs in 4 hrs (vs. 50 hrs manual) |
| **ML Fatigue** | 85% time reduction, 23% accuracy improvement |
| **Time Savings** | 60-80% on typical engineering analyses |
| **AI Integration** | Multi-model orchestration (Claude, Codex, Gemini) for engineering workflows |

#### Proven Track Record

- **Platform life extension:** Automated structural integrity assessment for aging offshore platforms
- **Subsea FEA:** Batch finite element analysis automation for subsea components
- **Wind foundations:** Design optimization for offshore wind turbine support structures
- **Riser analysis:** Sensitivity studies and fatigue life prediction
- **Field economics:** BSEE production and economic modeling
- **Marine safety:** Statistical correlation analysis for offshore incidents

#### Strategic Value

An acquiring firm gains:
1. **Immediate capability** — Production code, not prototypes
2. **Domain expertise** — Deep offshore engineering knowledge embedded in every module
3. **AI-native workflow** — A working model for AI-augmented engineering that can be scaled across the organization
4. **Competitive differentiation** — Offer clients faster, more accurate engineering deliverables
5. **Talent** — A founder-engineer who bridges offshore engineering and AI/ML

#### What We're Looking For

A&CE is exploring acquisition, sponsorship, or strategic partnership with an engineering firm that wants to:
- Accelerate digital transformation with production-ready tools
- Differentiate through AI-enhanced engineering services
- Acquire deep offshore engineering + AI/ML expertise

# 4. Anthropic Outreach

## a) Alex Albert (@alexalbert__ on X) — Claude Relations, Anthropic

**Option 1: Public Tweet / Quote Tweet**
> @alexalbert__ Built something wild with Claude Code: a workspace-hub orchestrating 704+ Python modules for offshore engineering analysis. Claude handles architecture, Codex handles implementation, Gemini handles research — all coordinated through Claude Code as the central brain.
>
> 221 S-N fatigue curves from 17 international standards, OrcaFlex/AQWA batch automation, ML-enhanced fatigue assessment. Real engineering, real production code, real 60-80% time savings.
>
> Claude Code isn't just a coding assistant — it's become the operating system for an entire engineering firm. Thread below 🧵

**Option 2: X DM**
> Hey Alex — I've been using Claude Code as the central orchestrator for my offshore engineering firm (A&CE). Quick stats:
>
> - 704+ production Python modules managed through Claude Code
> - AI agent orchestration: Claude (architecture) + Codex (implementation) + Gemini (research)
> - Domain: offshore energy — fatigue analysis, structural engineering, OrcaFlex automation
> - Real results: 60-80% time savings, 23% accuracy improvement on ML fatigue
>
> The workspace-hub pattern might be interesting for Anthropic's developer community — it's Claude Code as an engineering firm's operating system, not just a code assistant.
>
> Happy to do a writeup or demo if this is the kind of use case you'd want to showcase. Open to chatting?

## b) Boris Cherny (Creator of Claude Code) — LinkedIn

> Hi Boris — I'm a power user of Claude Code running an unusual setup: an offshore engineering firm where Claude Code orchestrates 704+ production Python modules.
>
> The architecture pattern that might interest you:
> - Claude Code as the central "brain" managing the workspace
> - Multi-agent orchestration: Claude for architecture decisions, Codex for parallel implementation, Gemini for research
> - Domain: offshore energy — fatigue analysis (221 S-N curves from 17 standards), OrcaFlex/AQWA batch automation, ML-enhanced structural assessment
> - AGENTS.md and workspace conventions as the connective tissue
>
> The result: a solo engineer operating with the throughput of a team of 10, with 60-80% time savings on typical offshore engineering analyses.
>
> This is Claude Code as an "engineering firm operating system" — not just coding assistance. Would love to share the workspace pattern if it's useful for the Claude Code community. Open to a technical deep-dive conversation?

## c) Irina Ghose (Managing Director, Anthropic India) — LinkedIn

> Hi Irina — Congratulations on the Anthropic India role! I read about your focus on Indian enterprises using Claude for mission-critical use cases.
>
> I run A&CE, an offshore engineering analytics firm built entirely on Claude Code. The use case:
> - 704+ production Python modules for offshore energy (fatigue, structural, hydrodynamic analysis)
> - Claude as the architectural brain orchestrating multi-agent engineering workflows
> - Deployed on real offshore projects globally
>
> India has a massive offshore engineering services industry (L&T, Worley India, TechnipFMC India, Wood India) that could adopt this AI-native engineering model. This could be a compelling "mission-critical" enterprise use case for the India market.
>
> Would welcome a conversation about how Anthropic India might support or showcase this kind of deep engineering application.

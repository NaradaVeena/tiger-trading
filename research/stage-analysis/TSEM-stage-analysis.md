# TSEM (Tower Semiconductor) — Multiple Timeframe Stage Analysis

**Date:** February 16, 2026  
**Price:** $128.74  
**Methodology:** Brian Shannon Multiple Timeframe Analysis  
**Analyst:** Narada (Tiger Trading)

---

## Executive Summary

TSEM is in a **Stage 2 uptrend on both daily and weekly timeframes**, currently undergoing a healthy pullback/consolidation after a powerful run to $149.57. The multi-year trend is strongly bullish, the pullback is orderly with diminishing volume, and the stock is resting on its 50-day SMA with the VP POC ($121.30) as backstop support. This is a textbook Stage 2 "broken stairstep" correction — the type Shannon identifies as the lowest-risk entry within an established trend.

**Verdict: Actionable long on the next higher high from this consolidation zone.**

## 1. Current Stage Identification

### Daily Timeframe: Stage 2 (Mid-to-Late Markup) — Correcting Within Trend

**Price structure:** Higher highs and higher lows since August 2025 (~$47 → $149.57). The stock has pulled back ~14% from the January high to current $128.74. This is the first meaningful correction in a parabolic advance.

**Evidence:**
- Price remains above SMA50 ($125.29) — the key trend-defining MA
- SMA5 ($136.17) > SMA20 ($133.12) > SMA50 ($125.29) — bullish alignment intact
- SMA200 rising steadily around ~$90-95 — deeply positive slope, confirming strong long-term buyer conviction
- The pullback has NOT violated any higher low structure yet
- RSI at 48.8 — reset from overbought levels, neutral territory, room to run

**Stage 2 confirmation checklist:**
- ✅ Higher highs and higher lows
- ✅ Short MA > Intermediate MA > Long MA
- ✅ All MAs with positive slope
- ✅ Price above all major MAs (50, 200)
- ✅ 6-month VWAP ($100.48) well below price — trend buyers in profit

### Weekly Timeframe: Stage 2 (Mature Markup)

**Price structure (reconstructed from annual data):**
- 2024: $30 → $51 (+69%)
- 2025: $51 → $117 (+128%)  
- 2026 YTD: $121 → $149.57 → $128.74 (current pullback)

This is a **multi-year Stage 2 uptrend** — the weekly chart shows a powerful staircase from lower-left to upper-right over 2+ years. The stock has compounded at extraordinary rates and is now 4x+ its 2024 lows.

**Weekly stage status:** Firmly Stage 2. No evidence of Stage 3 distribution. The current pause is the first real consolidation after the Nov-Jan acceleration from ~$80 to $150.

## 2. Moving Average Alignment

### Daily MAs
| MA | Value | Slope | Position vs Price |
|-----|-------|-------|-------------------|
| SMA5 | $136.17 | Declining (short-term pullback) | Above price |
| SMA20 | $133.12 | Flattening (was rising) | Above price |
| SMA50 | $125.29 | Rising | Below price |
| SMA200 | ~$92-95 | Rising strongly | Well below price |
| VWAP (6mo) | $100.48 | N/A | Well below price |

**Interpretation:**
- The short-term MAs (5, 20) are above price — this is the correction. Price has dipped below its 5 and 20-day MAs, which is normal during a pullback.
- The SMA50 at $125.29 is acting as **dynamic support** — price bounced right at this level. This is the Shannon "line in the sand" for the intermediate trend.
- The SMA200 rising at ~$92-95 is the ultimate backstop — deeply below price, confirming the long-term trend is powerfully bullish.
- **Key Shannon signal:** When price consolidates above a rising longer-term MA (50 or 200), it "often leads to significant upside moves once buyers regain control of the short-term trend." That's exactly the setup here.

### Weekly MAs (Estimated)
- Weekly 10 MA: ~$130-135 (price near this level)
- Weekly 20 MA: ~$110-115 (rising, well below)
- Weekly 50 MA: ~$70-80 (rising, deeply below)

All weekly MAs rising with bullish alignment. No crossover concerns.

## 3. Volume Character

**Assessment: Volume CONFIRMS the bullish Stage 2 trend.**

From the daily chart:
- **Rally legs (Aug→Oct, Nov→Jan):** Accompanied by expanding volume, particularly notable spikes during the November breakout through $80 and the December push to $120+. This is the healthy Stage 2 pattern — "increasing volume as stock rises."
- **Current pullback (late Jan→Feb):** Volume is **diminishing** on the decline. This is textbook healthy — "diminishing volume on pullbacks" confirms sellers are not motivated and the correction is profit-taking, not distribution.
- **No churning signal:** There is no evidence of heavy volume without upside progress (which would signal Stage 3 distribution). The volume profile on the decline is orderly.
- **VP POC at $121.30** with heavy volume concentration: This represents where the most shares changed hands — it's a natural magnet and support level.

**Shannon volume verdict:** The volume pattern is clean Stage 2. Expansion on rallies, contraction on pullbacks. No distribution signals.

## 4. Key Support & Resistance Levels

### Support Levels (from VP data and price structure)

| Level | Type | Strength | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| **$125.29** | SMA50 (dynamic) | Strong | Currently being tested and holding |
| **$121.30** | VP POC | Very Strong | Highest volume node — major institutional acceptance level |
| **$117-118** | Prior breakout / 2026 low | Strong | January base and yearly open area |
| **$100** | 6-month VWAP | Strong | Round number + VWAP confluence |
| **$92-95** | SMA200 | Very Strong | Long-term trend support, rising |
| **$77.62** | VP VAL | Moderate | Lower edge of value area — catastrophic support |

### Resistance Levels

| Level | Type | Strength | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| **$133-136** | SMA5/SMA20 convergence | Moderate | Short-term overhead supply from recent sellers |
| **$147.86** | VP VAH / Prior high zone | Strong | January peak area, upper value area |
| **$149.57** | 52-week high | Very Strong | All-time recent high, major psychological level |
| **$160-165** | Measured move target | Projected | Breakout extension from $117 base |

## 5. Multi-Timeframe Alignment

| Timeframe | Stage | Trend | MAs | Bias |
|-----------|-------|-------|-----|------|
| Weekly | Stage 2 (mature) | Strong uptrend | All rising, bullish order | Long |
| Daily | Stage 2 (correcting) | Uptrend with pullback | Bullish order, price near 50-day | Long on pullback |

**Alignment: BULLISH across timeframes.**

The weekly uptrend is the dominant force. The daily correction is occurring within the context of a powerful weekly Stage 2. Per Shannon: "Short-term corrections occurring in the context of a longer-term timeframe typically will be resolved in the direction of the longer-term trend."

The MACD on the daily is showing a minor bearish crossover (histogram at -0.893), which simply reflects the short-term pullback — not a trend reversal. RSI at 48.8 has reset from overbought, creating room for the next leg.

**This is the highest-probability setup Shannon describes:** multi-timeframe alignment with a short-term correction providing entry within the primary trend.

## 6. Risk/Reward Assessment

### Trade Setup: Long on next higher high from consolidation

**Entry trigger:** First daily close above SMA20 ($133.12) with expanding volume, confirming buyers have regained short-term control. Alternatively, a bounce off SMA50 ($125.29) with a higher low forming above $121.

**Stop placement:** Below the most recent higher low / SMA50 zone.  
- **Conservative stop:** $120 (below VP POC at $121.30 — if this breaks, the thesis is damaged)
- **Aggressive stop:** $124 (just below SMA50 at $125.29)

**Price targets:**
- **Target 1:** $148-150 (retest of January highs / VP VAH) — high probability
- **Target 2:** $165 (measured move from $117 base breakout, adding the ~$30 range)
- **Target 3:** $180+ (if Stage 2 acceleration continues with NVIDIA catalyst)

### R/R Calculation (using entry at ~$133, stop at $120)

| Scenario | Entry | Stop | Target | Risk | Reward | R:R |
|----------|-------|------|--------|------|--------|-----|
| Conservative | $133 | $120 | $150 | $13 | $17 | 1.3:1 ❌ |
| Base case | $128 (current) | $120 | $150 | $8 | $22 | **2.75:1** ⚠️ |
| Optimal | $126 (near SMA50) | $120 | $150 | $6 | $24 | **4:1** ✅ |
| Extended | $128 | $120 | $165 | $8 | $37 | **4.6:1** ✅ |

**R:R Verdict:** At current price ($128.74) with a stop at $120 and target at $150, R:R is ~2.75:1 — close but not quite 3:1. However:
- Buying closer to SMA50 (~$125-126) achieves 4:1+
- Using the extended target ($165) achieves 4.6:1
- The probability is skewed bullish due to multi-timeframe alignment

**The optimal entry is on a dip toward $125-126 (SMA50 test) or on a breakout above $136 (SMA5 recapture) with the stop tightened to $128.**

## 7. Recommendation

### 🟢 ACTIONABLE LONG — Stage 2 Pullback Entry

**Conviction: HIGH**

**Why this setup works:**
1. **Multi-year Stage 2 uptrend** — weekly and daily aligned bullish
2. **Textbook pullback** — orderly correction with diminishing volume to the 50-day SMA
3. **VP POC at $121.30** provides institutional-grade support beneath the stop
4. **RSI reset to neutral (48.8)** — overbought condition fully unwound
5. **SMA200 rising strongly** — "the voice of the market" is bullish
6. **Founder-led + NVIDIA partnership** — fundamental catalyst for continued demand

**Entry plan (tiered):**
1. **Tier 1 (1/3 position):** Current level ~$128-129, or on a dip to $125-126 (SMA50 test)
2. **Tier 2 (1/3 position):** On first daily close above SMA20 ($133) with volume confirmation
3. **Tier 3 (1/3 position):** On breakout above $150 (new all-time high)

**Stop:** $119.50 (below VP POC at $121.30 — gives the support level room to breathe)

**Targets:**
- T1: $150 (prior high retest)
- T2: $165 (measured move)
- T3: $180+ (trend extension)

### What Would Invalidate This Setup
- Daily close below VP POC ($121.30) on heavy volume → Stage 2 in serious jeopardy
- SMA50 rolling over and declining → transition concern
- Heavy volume churning without upside progress at $130-135 → distribution signal
- Weekly trend structure breaking (close below $100) → Stage 3 confirmed

### Shannon Framework Alignment Score

| Factor | Score | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Stage identification | ✅ Strong | Clear Stage 2 on both timeframes |
| MA alignment | ✅ Strong | Bullish order maintained, all rising |
| Volume character | ✅ Strong | Expansion on rallies, contraction on pullback |
| S/R structure | ✅ Strong | Clean levels, VP POC backstop |
| MTF alignment | ✅ Strong | Weekly and daily both bullish |
| R:R ratio | ⚠️ Adequate | ~2.75:1 at current price; 4:1+ at optimal entry |
| **Overall** | **✅ High Conviction** | **5 of 6 factors strong** |

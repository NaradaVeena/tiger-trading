# Hyperscaler Capex vs. Company Revenue Guidance
## Gap Analysis: What the 2026 AI Spending Surge Actually Implies for the Tiger Watchlist

**Research Date:** February 19, 2026
**Portfolio:** Tiger ($100K AI Infrastructure)
**Key Question:** Hyperscaler AI capex is up ~75% YoY to $660–690B. How much of that is already baked into company guidance, and where is the guidance still catching up?

---

## The Setup: A Non-Linear Capex Surge

The 2026 hyperscaler capex acceleration is not a gentle slope. It's a step-function:

| Company | 2025 Capex (est.) | 2026 Guidance | YoY Increase |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Amazon | ~$130B | $200B | +$70B (+54%) |
| Alphabet | ~$85B | $175–185B | +$95B (+112%) |
| Microsoft | ~$80B | $120B+ | +$40B (+50%) |
| Meta | ~$70B | $115–135B | +$55B (+79%) |
| Oracle | ~$20B | $50B | +$30B (+150%) |
| **Big 5 Total** | **~$385B** | **$660–690B** | **+$280B (+75%)** |

**Critical nuance:** This increase is heavily H2 2026-weighted. Alphabet explicitly said capacity
comes online through the year. Amazon's $200B plan is a full-year commitment. The revenue impact
for picks-and-shovels companies lags by 1–4 quarters depending on category.

### How $660B Breaks Down by Category

| Category | % of Capex | Implied $ (2026) | Key Watchlist Beneficiaries |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| AI chips / GPUs | ~33% | $218B | Indirect (TSEM via SiPho) |
| Non-GPU servers | ~27% | $178B | ALAB (embedded connectivity) |
| Networking | ~10% | $66B | ANET, CRDO, COHR, FN |
| Storage | ~7% | $46B | — |
| Cooling / Power | ~14% | $92B | NVT |
| Construction / Civil | ~9% | $59B | PWR |

### ALAB — Astera Labs (PCIe/CXL Connectivity)

**Most Recent Earnings:** Q4 2025, reported February 10, 2026

| Metric | Q4 2025 Actual | Q1 2026 Guidance | YoY |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|-----|
| Revenue | $270.6M | $286M–$297M | +83% vs Q1 2025's $159.4M |
| Full Year 2025 | $852.5M (+115% YoY) | Annualized guidance: ~$1.15–1.2B | |

**Key Management Commentary:**
*"We're seeing very broad-based demand across all our hyperscaler customers."* Amazon $466M
warrant agreement validates multi-year revenue commitment. Hyperscaler product qualifications
now complete across all major customers.

**Capex-to-Revenue Translation:**

- **Category:** PCIe/CXL/Ethernet connectivity chips embedded in AI servers and fabric
- **Addressable slice of capex:** ~1% of the $396B server/compute category = ~$4B connectivity TAM
- **ALAB market share:** ~20–25% of PCIe retimer/CXL hub market (dominant)
- **Capex-implied 2026 revenue:** ~$0.8–1.0B (conservative) to $1.3B (full penetration)
- **2025 actual:** $852.5M
- **Revenue timing lag:** 0–1 quarter (connectivity chips ship with server build)

**Gap Analysis:**

Capex math implies $1.0–1.3B for 2026. Q1 guidance ($291.5M midpoint) annualizes to ~$1.15–1.2B
— essentially in-line. HOWEVER: Q1 guidance does not yet reflect the Amazon warrant ramp and
the Scorpio fabric switch (scale-out Ethernet) beginning meaningful revenue contribution in H2
2026. The non-linear H2 capex acceleration adds upside not visible in Q1 guidance.

**Signal:** **GUIDANCE IN-LINE, H2 UPSIDE RISK FROM AMAZON + SCORPIO**
*Capex-implied ceiling: $1.3B | Current annualized guide: ~$1.15B | Gap: ~$150M (13%)*

### CRDO — Credo Technology (High-Speed SerDes / AEC)

**Most Recent Earnings:** Q2 FY2026, reported December 1, 2025
**Pre-announcement:** Q3 FY2026 preliminary revenue released February 9, 2026

| Metric | Q2 FY2026 Actual | Q3 FY2026 Original Guide | Q3 FY2026 Pre-Ann. | YoY (Q3) |
|--------|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Revenue | $268M (+272% YoY) | $335M–$345M | **$404M–$408M** | +201% vs Q3 FY2025's $135M |

**Key Management Commentary:**
The gap between original guidance ($340M) and actual ($406M) is the loudest signal in the
entire watchlist. This represents a 20% guidance beat — in a single quarter. Q4 FY2026
expected to show mid-single digit sequential growth (~$420M+).

Annualized FY2026 run rate: **~$1.5–1.6B** (vs FY2025 of ~$440M = >200% YoY for the full year)

**Capex-to-Revenue Translation:**

- **Category:** SerDes and AEC in AI networking scale-out (~$66B networking category)
- **SerDes/AEC market:** ~$3–4B of the $66B networking capex
- **CRDO market share:** ~88% of AEC market; growing share in 224G SerDes
- **Capex-implied 2026 revenue:** $1.5–2.0B
- **2025 actual (FY2025 ended May 2025):** ~$440M
- **Revenue timing lag:** 0–1 quarter (AECs ship with networking hardware)

**Gap Analysis:**

This is the most dramatic example of guidance lagging capex reality — and the company already
partially revealed it via the Q3 pre-announcement. The original Q3 guide ($340M) was set in
early December 2025 before hyperscaler 2026 capex plans fully crystallized. By February, actual
orders were running $65M above guide.

*Capex-implied FY2026: $1.5–2.0B | Current annualized run rate: $1.56B | Gap is closing fast —
but guidance still has not caught up to capex ceiling.*

**Signal:** **GUIDANCE CATCHING UP — CAPEX CEILING NOT YET REACHED**
*The pre-announcement was the first data point proving guidance was too low. The H2 2026 capex
acceleration likely means FY2026 exits the year at a $400M+/quarter run rate.*

### FN — Fabrinet (Optical Manufacturing)

**Most Recent Earnings:** Q2 FY2026, reported February 2, 2026

| Metric | Q2 FY2026 Actual | Q3 FY2026 Guidance | YoY |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|-----|
| Revenue | $1.13B (+36% YoY) | $1.15B–$1.20B | ~35% YoY |
| Optical comms | $833M | Growing | |
| Full Year FY2025 | ~$3.4B | Annualized: ~$4.7B | +38% implied |

**Key Management Commentary:**
Data center revenue: 76% of total. NVIDIA relationship deepening — Fabrinet manufactures
NVIDIA's proprietary optical transceivers. The 16% sequential jump in Q2 was driven by
400G → 800G upgrade cycle and initial 1.6T transceiver volume.

**Capex-to-Revenue Translation:**

- **Category:** Optical transceiver manufacturing (part of networking $66B + CPO in compute)
- **Optical transceiver market:** $13.6B (2025) → ~$20B (2026, +47% estimate)
- **FN manufacturing share:** ~20–25% (dominant for complex/high-speed optical assemblies)
- **Capex-implied 2026 revenue:** ~$3.5–4.5B (optical communications segment alone)
- **2025 actual:** ~$3.4B total
- **Revenue timing lag:** 0–1 quarter

**Gap Analysis:**

FN is the only company in the watchlist where current guidance EXCEEDS the simple capex-math
implied number. Their Q3 FY2026 guidance of $1.175B midpoint annualizes to ~$4.7B — above the
$3.5–4.5B capex-implied range. This is because: (1) FN serves non-hyperscaler customers too
(telecom segment), and (2) their NVIDIA relationship gives them captive demand that scales with
NVIDIA's own data center shipments.

**Signal:** **GUIDANCE AHEAD OF LINEAR CAPEX MATH — NVIDIA RELATIONSHIP IS THE ALPHA**
*The NVIDIA direct manufacturing relationship is a moat that makes FN less dependent on
hyperscaler capex timing — they track GPU shipments, not capex commitments.*

### NVT — nVent Electric (Liquid Cooling)

**Most Recent Earnings:** Q4 2025, reported February 6, 2026

| Metric | Q4 2025 Actual | Q1 2026 Guidance | Full Year 2026 |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Revenue | $1.067B (+42% YoY) | +34–36% YoY reported | +15–18% total company |
| Data Center segment | >$1B for full year 2025 | Infrastructure >50% of 2026 sales | |
| Backlog | $2.3B (3x prior year) | | |

**Key Figures:**
- Data center revenue 2025: **>$1B** (from $600M in 2024 = **+67% YoY**)
- Total company 2025 revenue (implied): ~$3.8–4.0B
- Full year 2026 total company guidance: $4.3–4.7B (15–18% growth)
- New Blaine, Minnesota facility began ramping liquid cooling production in January 2026
- Organic orders: +30% in Q4 2025

**Key Management Quote:**
*"Infrastructure made up 45% of 2025 sales, growing over 50% organically for the year and
expected to exceed half of 2026 sales."* — Beth Wozniak, CEO

**Capex-to-Revenue Translation:**

- **Category:** Liquid cooling in facility infrastructure (~14% of $660B = $92B)
- **Data center liquid cooling specifically:** ~$7–10B market in 2025, growing 25–30% CAGR
- **NVT market share in DC cooling:** ~10–15%
- **Capex-implied DC cooling 2026:** ~$8.75–13B market; NVT capture = **$1.3–2.0B**
- **NVT DC revenue 2025:** >$1B → implied YoY: **+30–100%**
- **Revenue timing lag:** 1–2 quarters (cooling infrastructure leads server deployment)

**Gap Analysis:**

Here is the most interesting discrepancy. NVT's *data center segment* grew 67% in 2025
($600M → $1B+), tracking closely with capex math. But the *total company* guidance of 15–18%
growth looks conservative because ~70% of revenue is still non-data-center. The mix shift is the
story: as infrastructure approaches 50%+ of total company revenue in 2026, the DC growth rate
(implied 50–80% by capex math) will increasingly dominate the total company number.

The $2.3B backlog (3x YoY) provides extraordinary visibility. Backlog-to-revenue coverage is
exceptional — almost all of 2026 data center revenue is already in backlog.

**Signal:** **TOTAL COMPANY GUIDANCE CONSERVATIVE DUE TO MIX SHIFT — DC SEGMENT TRACKING CAPEX MATH**
*The 15–18% total company guide masks a 50–80% data center segment implied growth. As
infrastructure segment crosses 50% of revenue, the blended growth rate must re-rate upward.*

### TSEM — Tower Semiconductor (Silicon Photonics Foundry)

**Most Recent Earnings:** Q4 2025, reported February 11, 2026

| Metric | Q4 2025 Actual | Q1 2026 Guidance | Full Year 2025 |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Revenue | $440M (+14% YoY) **record quarter** | ~$412M (±5%) = ~15% YoY | $1.57B |
| SiPho revenue (Q4) | $95M | H1 ramp continues | $228M FY2025 |
| SiPho FY2025 | $228M (from $106M in 2024 = **+115%**) | Targeting doubling in 2026 = **~$456M** | |

**Key Management Commentary:**
Tower invested $920M in CapEx for 5x SiPho wafer capacity by Q4 2026. They are the primary
foundry partner for 1.6T optical transceivers — the next-generation product that every AI data
center needs for 2026–2027 cluster builds. Q4 SiPho run rate of $95M/quarter = $380M annual
already. Management targets doubling SiPho in 2026 to ~$456M, implying SiPho exits 2026
at a $200M+ quarterly run rate.

**Capex-to-Revenue Translation:**

- **Category:** SiPho foundry services (inside the optical/networking ~$66B)
- **SiPho foundry market:** ~$1.5–2.5B in 2026 (rapidly expanding)
- **TSEM market share:** ~50–60% (dominant — NVIDIA's primary foundry partner)
- **Capex-implied SiPho revenue:** ~$0.75–1.5B (broad range due to CPO timing uncertainty)
- **Management guidance:** ~$456M SiPho for 2026 (doubling)
- **Revenue timing lag:** 2–3 quarters (foundry capacity ≠ immediate revenue; requires customer
  design-in and qualification)

**Gap Analysis:**

Tower's management guide of $456M SiPho may be conservative relative to capex math, but the
timing lag (2–3 quarters for foundry qualification) means much of the 2026 capex ramp doesn't
flow through to TSEM revenue until Q3–Q4 2026 or even 2027. The $920M CapEx investment into
SiPho capacity is management's own signal that they expect demand to exceed current guidance by
the time they can capture it. The real question is execution speed.

**Signal:** **GUIDE LIKELY CONSERVATIVE; TRUE INFLECTION IN 2027 — 2026 IS A BUILD YEAR**
*SiPho doubling in 2026 is well-supported by capex math. Further re-rating depends on CPO
commercial deployment timeline (NVIDIA targets 2026–2027).*

### ANET — Arista Networks (AI Ethernet Networking)

**Most Recent Earnings:** Q4 2025, reported February 12, 2026

| Metric | Q4 2025 Actual | Q1 2026 Guidance | Full Year 2026 Guide |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Revenue | $2.49B (+28.6% YoY) | $2.6B | +25% = ~$11.25B |
| Full Year 2025 | $9.01B | | |
| Q1 2025 (prior year) | $2.005B | | |
| Q1 2026 YoY | — | **+29.7%** vs $2.005B | |

**AI-Specific Guidance:**
AI networking revenue target for 2026: **$3.25B** (vs. implied ~$1.5B in 2025 = >100% growth
in the AI-specific sub-segment). Total company guided at 25% to acknowledge broader product mix.

**Key Management Quote:**
*"The AI networking opportunity is real, it's accelerating, and we are seeing it in our bookings."*

**Capex-to-Revenue Translation:**

- **Category:** Ethernet switching in networking ($66B category)
- **AI-specific ethernet TAM:** ~$15B by 2027; ~$10–12B in 2026
- **ANET market share:** ~22% of DC Ethernet switches; higher in AI-specific deployments
- **Capex-implied 2026 revenue:** $10–12B total company range; $2.2–2.6B AI-specific
- **2025 actual:** $9.01B
- **Revenue timing lag:** 0–1 quarter (switches deploy with server builds)

**Gap Analysis:**

ANET's 25% total company guidance is roughly in-line with capex-math — but it actually
*understates* the AI-specific segment acceleration (+100% in AI revenue). The blended 25% reflects
the fact that ANET still has a large enterprise campus/routing business that grows at a slower
pace, pulling down the reported growth rate.

The risk here is the inverse: if hyperscalers hit the "Blackwell ROI air gap" Baker identified —
3 quarters of training capex without commensurate inference revenue — MSFT and Meta could
briefly pause network builds. ANET's $3.25B AI revenue target requires continued uninterrupted
hyperscaler spending in H2 2026.

**Signal:** **AI SEGMENT GUIDANCE IS AGGRESSIVE RELATIVE TO CAPEX MATH; EXECUTION IS THE RISK**
*Capex implies $2.2–2.6B AI networking; ANET guiding to $3.25B. The gap is ANET betting on
share gains vs. InfiniBand. Realistic if UEC 1.0 displaces Infiniband as expected.*

### COHR — Coherent Corp (Optical Transceivers)

**Most Recent Earnings:** Q2 FY2026, reported ~February 4, 2026

| Metric | Q2 FY2026 Actual | Q3 FY2026 Guidance | YoY |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|-----|
| Revenue | $1.69B (+17% YoY) | $1.70B–$1.84B | +15–23% vs Q3 FY2025's $1.50B |
| Datacom segment | >70% of revenue | Accelerating | |
| Book-to-bill | **>4x** | — | — |
| Full Year FY2025 | $5.81B | FY2026 implied: ~$7B+ | +20%+ |

**Key Management Commentary:**
Book-to-bill exceeding **4x** is the loudest single data point in this entire analysis.
It means for every $1 of revenue recognized in Q2, Coherent booked $4+ in new orders.
Bookings are extending into **2027** — customers are reserving capacity 12–18 months out.
InP 6-inch wafer production ramping toward 80% of target capacity to meet demand.

**Capex-to-Revenue Translation:**

- **Category:** Optical transceiver components (networking $66B + CPO in compute)
- **Optical transceiver TAM:** $13.6B (2024) → ~$20B (2026), 25%+ CAGR
- **COHR market share:** ~20–25% of transceiver market
- **Capex-implied 2026 revenue (datacom-weighted):** $4.0–5.0B datacom; $7B+ total company
- **2025 actual:** $5.81B (FY2025 ended June 2025)
- **Revenue timing lag:** 0–1 quarter

**Gap Analysis:**

The 4x book-to-bill is the critical signal: it tells you definitively that COHR's guidance
is NOT reflecting actual demand. Revenue is constrained by manufacturing capacity, not by
orders. The company cannot ship fast enough to match what customers are ordering.

In a normal book-to-bill environment (1.0–1.2x), guidance reflects demand well. At 4x,
guidance is a manufacturing capacity constraint — revenue will grow as fast as COHR can
produce. Their 80% ramp on InP wafers is the near-term bottleneck; once they hit full
capacity utilization, revenue should converge toward the $7B+ capex-implied ceiling.

The $7B+ FY2026 total company consensus vs. $5.81B FY2025 implies 20%+ growth. Capex
math supports $7–8B. Book-to-bill suggests capacity, not demand, is the binding constraint.

**Signal:** **BIGGEST GUIDANCE GAP IN THE WATCHLIST — CONSTRAINED BY CAPACITY, NOT DEMAND**
*4x book-to-bill means guidance is a manufacturing ceiling, not a demand signal. True
demand is 4x above current quarterly revenue. As InP capacity comes online through 2026,
the revenue gap closes rapidly.*

### PWR — Quanta Services (Data Center Construction / Electrical)

**Status:** Q4 2025 earnings reporting **this morning** (February 19, 2026, before market open).
All data below is as of Q3 2025 (most recent reported quarter).

| Metric | Q3 2025 Actual | Most Recent | Full Year 2025 (est.) |
|--------|---------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Revenue | $7.63B (+17% YoY) | — | ~$26–27B |
| Backlog | $39.2B (+31% YoY) | — | — |
| Backlog-to-Revenue | 1.5x TTM | — | Exceptional visibility |

**Key Management Commentary (Q3 2025):**
Data center and digital infrastructure is the fastest-growing segment. The company expanded
renewable energy and data center electrical construction capacity specifically for AI
infrastructure buildouts. Backlog of $39.2B provides 18+ months of revenue visibility.

**Capex-to-Revenue Translation:**

- **Category:** Data center construction, electrical infrastructure ($59B construction bucket)
- **PWR addressable:** ~25–35% of electrical and construction work for major DC buildouts
- **Capex-implied 2026 revenue:** $28–32B total company (15–25% growth)
- **2025 actual:** ~$26–27B
- **Revenue timing lag:** 2–4 quarters (construction follows capex commitment; permits, site
  prep, and electrical installation span 6–18 months after announcement)

**Gap Analysis:**

PWR has the longest revenue lag of any company in the watchlist — which means the 2026
capex surge will not fully show up in 2026 revenue. The $280B additional hyperscaler capex
announced in late 2025 / early 2026 flows into electrical/construction revenue in 2027–2028.
However, PWR's $39.2B backlog is already $13B above prior-year backlog — this represents
capex commitments from 2024–2025 announcements that will drive 2026 revenue.

**Signal:** **2026 REVENUE REFLECTS 2024–2025 CAPEX; 2026 CAPEX SURGE FLOWS INTO 2027–2028**
*The longest lag of any watchlist name. Buy PWR for 2027–2028 revenue growth, not 2026.*

## Key Insights: Where Guidance Is Lying to You

### 1. COHR: The Loudest Signal Nobody Is Talking About

A 4x book-to-bill means customers are placing 4x the orders that COHR can currently fill.
This is not a demand question — it is a supply question. As InP wafer capacity comes online
through H1 2026, COHR's revenue growth will re-accelerate sharply. This is the most
underappreciated dynamic in the watchlist.

*Watch for:* Q3 FY2026 guidance beat driven by manufacturing throughput improvement.

### 2. CRDO: Guidance Already Proved Wrong — Once

The Q3 FY2026 pre-announcement ($404M vs. $340M guide) was a 20% guidance beat in a single
quarter. This happened because hyperscaler demand accelerated faster than CRDO's December
guidance anticipated. The pattern suggests Q4 FY2026 guidance ($420M+) is similarly conservative
if 2026 capex ramp is H2-weighted as expected.

*Watch for:* Similar pre-announcement pattern in May 2026 for Q4 FY2026.

### 3. NVT: The Mix Shift Story Nobody Has Priced

NVT guided 15–18% total company growth. But their data center segment grew 67% in 2025 and
is expected to exceed 50% of revenue in 2026. Simple math: if the DC segment (50%+ of revenue)
grows at 50%+ and the non-DC segment (50%) grows at flat-to-low-single-digits, blended
total company growth should be 25%+, not 15–18%. The 15–18% guide is probably using the
non-DC segment as a drag anchor that understates the DC segment's acceleration.

*Watch for:* Full-year 2026 guidance revision upward after Q1 2026 earnings.

### 4. FN: Ahead of Capex Math = NVIDIA Is the Real Driver

Fabrinet's guidance exceeds simple hyperscaler capex math because their NVIDIA direct
manufacturing relationship scales with GPU shipments, not with hyperscaler capex decisions.
As Blackwell ramps, FN revenue accelerates regardless of whether hyperscaler capex announcements
are H1 or H2 loaded. This makes FN the most predictable name in the watchlist.

### 5. ALAB: Amazon Warrant + Scorpio = H2 Step-Function

ALAB's Q1 guidance (+83% YoY) looks impressive but is based on existing run-rate business.
The Amazon $466M warrant vesting and the Scorpio scale-out fabric switch ramp could create a
step-function increase in H2 2026 revenue that is not reflected in Q1 guidance.

### 6. PWR: Buy for 2027, Not 2026

The construction and electrical infrastructure lag (2–4 quarters from capex to revenue)
means PWR's 2026 revenue reflects 2024–2025 hyperscaler decisions. The 75% capex surge
announced for 2026 will flow into PWR's 2027–2028 backlog. Holding PWR means you're
betting on the multi-year infrastructure supercycle, not the 2026 print.

## Revenue Timing Cascade

The non-linear capex increase flows through the supply chain in waves:

```
CAPEX COMMITMENT ANNOUNCED (2026 H1)
          |
          | (0–1Q lag)
          ↓
Networking chips, connectivity silicon, optical transceivers
[CRDO, ALAB, COHR, FN]    ← Revenue impact: 2026 H1/H2
          |
          | (1–2Q lag)
          ↓
Cooling infrastructure, power management
[NVT]                       ← Revenue impact: 2026 H2
          |
          | (2–3Q lag)
          ↓
Foundry qualification cycles, optical components
[TSEM]                      ← Revenue impact: 2026 H2 / 2027
          |
          | (2–4Q lag)
          ↓
Construction, electrical infrastructure
[PWR]                       ← Revenue impact: 2027–2028
```

**Implication:** If you believe the 2026 capex surge is real (Baker's thesis, confirmed by
all 5 hyperscaler managements on Q4 2025 calls), then:

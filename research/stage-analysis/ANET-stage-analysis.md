## 1. Current Stage Identification

### Weekly Timeframe: Stage 2 Correction (Bullish)

The weekly chart tells a clear story: ANET ran from ~$60 to ~$165 over roughly 8 months (Feb–Oct 2025) — a textbook Stage 2 markup of +175%. The stock then corrected sharply from $165 to $114 (-31%) in November, which is a deep but not fatal pullback within the context of that massive advance.

**Current weekly posture:** The stock has recovered to $141.59, well above the rising 20-week SMA ($136.41) and far above the 50-week SMA ($116.89). The weekly structure is a "broken stairstep" — a correction within a primary uptrend. The higher low at $114 (vs the Feb 2025 low of ~$60) preserves the weekly uptrend structure.

**Stage verdict — Weekly: Stage 2 (correction recovering).** The primary trend is up. The path of least resistance on the weekly is higher.

### Daily Timeframe: Late Stage 1 → Early Stage 2 Transition

Zooming into the daily, the Nov–Jan period ($114–$135) was a classic Stage 1 accumulation base:
- Price contracted into a range
- MAs crossed back and forth (indecision)
- Volume diminished during the basing period
- Higher lows formed: $114 → $121 → $127

In late January, the stock broke above the $135 base resistance with volume — the hallmark transition from Stage 1 to Stage 2 on the daily. It spiked to ~$145, pulled back to ~$127, and has now rallied strongly back to $141.59 on expanding volume.

**Late Stage 1 clues that have fired:**
- ✅ Higher lows ($114 → $121 → $127)
- ✅ Increased volume on the breakout attempt
- ✅ Multiple tests of the $135 resistance level
- ✅ Longer-term MAs flattening and beginning to rise
- ✅ Stock holding above the SMA50 ($132.87) and SMA200 (~$130)

**Stage verdict — Daily: Early Stage 2 (breakout from accumulation base).** The daily just transitioned. This is early innings.

## 2. Moving Average Alignment

### Daily MAs
| MA | Value | Slope | Position |
|----|-------|-------|----------|
| SMA5 | $140.51 | Rising | Price above |
| SMA20 | $138.33 | Rising | Price above |
| SMA50 | $132.87 | Rising (flattened, now turning up) | Price above |
| SMA200 | ~$130 | Flat to slightly rising | Price above |

**Daily MA alignment: SMA5 > SMA20 > SMA50 > SMA200 — all positive slope.** This is the textbook Stage 2 bullish stack. Price is above all major MAs. The SMA50 has flattened out after the November decline and is now curling higher — this is the key signal that the intermediate-term trend has shifted from decline to advance.

### Weekly MAs
| MA | Value | Slope | Position |
|----|-------|-------|----------|
| SMA5 | $137.40 | Rising | Price above |
| SMA20 | $136.41 | Flat to slightly rising | Price above |
| SMA50 | $116.89 | Rising | Price well above |

**Weekly MA alignment: SMA5 > SMA20 > SMA50 — positive.** The 20-week flattened during the correction but hasn't rolled over, and price has reclaimed it. The 50-week remains solidly in uptrend. The SMA200 on the weekly (~$83) is far below and still rising — the secular trend is firmly up.

**MA Assessment: Bullish.** The alignment on both timeframes confirms buyers are in control. The rising longer-term MAs on the weekly give confidence that corrections resolve higher. Shannon's key insight: "When the longer-term MA shows a positive slope, the odds favor resolution in the direction of the rising MA."

## 3. Volume Character

### Daily Volume
- **November crash:** Heavy volume on the decline — emotional selling, capitulation-style action
- **Dec–Jan basing:** Volume diminished significantly — classic Stage 1 characteristic. Reduced volatility, lack of catalysts, trading activity drying up
- **Late January breakout:** Volume expanded on the push above $135 — buyers competing for limited supply
- **Feb pullback to $127:** Volume contracted — healthy, sellers not motivated
- **Most recent rally (Feb 13):** Massive volume spike on a big green candle — this is the strongest volume bar in months, coinciding with the push back above $140

**Volume verdict: CONFIRMS the bullish thesis.** The pattern is textbook: diminishing volume during the base, expanding volume on breakout attempts, light volume on pullbacks. The massive volume on the most recent session is particularly bullish — it signals aggressive buying interest and potential institutional accumulation.

### Weekly Volume
Volume has been relatively steady on the weekly, with the recent weeks showing above-average volume as the stock emerged from its base. No distribution signals (heavy volume without upside progress) on the weekly.

## 4. Key Support & Resistance Levels

### From Volume Profile (6-month daily)
| Level | Type | Significance |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **$148.97** | VAH (6mo) | Upper boundary of value area — first major resistance target |
| **$138.75** | VAH (3mo) | Breakout level — just cleared, now acts as support |
| **$138.23** | VWAP (6mo) | Institutional anchor — price above = bullish positioning |
| **$130.07** | POC (6mo) | Highest volume node — massive support, the "center of gravity" |
| **$127.26** | POC (3mo) | Heavy volume support — the heart of the accumulation base |
| **$127.12** | VAL (6mo) | Lower value area boundary — critical support |
| **$121.98** | VAL (3mo) | Deep support — loss of this level would negate bullish thesis |
| **$114.52** | Swing low | The November capitulation low — ultimate backstop |

### Derived S/R Levels
| Level | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| **$155–165** | Prior highs | The October peak zone — major overhead resistance |
| **$145** | Recent swing high | Jan 28 high — near-term resistance |
| **$135** | Breakout level | Former Stage 1 ceiling, now support (polarity principle) |
| **$130** | POC + SMA200 confluence | Extremely strong support — POC and SMA200 converge here |

### Key Observation
The VP POC at $130 aligning with the SMA200 creates a **high-confluence support zone**. This is the level where the most shares have changed hands over 6 months AND where the 200-day moving average sits. This is institutional-grade support. A break below $130 would be a serious red flag.

## 5. Multi-Timeframe Alignment

| Timeframe | Stage | Trend | MAs | Volume | Bias |
|-----------|-------|-------|-----|--------|------|
| **Weekly** | Stage 2 (correcting) | Up | Bullish stack, rising | Neutral to constructive | Long |
| **Daily** | Early Stage 2 | Up (emerging) | Bullish stack, all rising | Confirms breakout | Long |

**Alignment: BULLISH CONVERGENCE.** Both timeframes agree on direction. The weekly provides the primary uptrend context (the wind at your back), and the daily is just beginning a fresh Stage 2 advance out of a 3-month base. Per Shannon: "The highest-probability trades come when there is alignment of trend across multiple timeframes."

This is the setup you want: a daily Stage 2 breakout occurring within the context of a weekly Stage 2 uptrend. The weekly correction has cleansed the excess from the $60→$165 run, and fresh accumulation has built a base of strong holders.

**RSI Confirmation:**
- Daily RSI: 54.6 — neutral, plenty of room to run
- Weekly RSI: 56.0 — neutral, recovering from the correction
- Neither timeframe is overbought, which means this move has runway

**MACD Note:** Both daily and weekly MACD show slight negative histogram readings (daily: -0.15, weekly: -0.91), suggesting the MACD line just crossed below the signal line. This is a minor cautionary flag — momentum has cooled slightly. However, in the context of a base breakout, MACD lagging is normal; price action and volume are leading indicators here, and both are bullish.

## 6. Risk/Reward Assessment

### Scenario A: Swing Trade (Conservative)
- **Entry:** $141.59 (current) or on pullback to $138–139 (VAH support)
- **Stop:** $130 (POC + SMA200 confluence) = **$11.59 risk**
- **Target 1:** $149 (6mo VAH) = $7.41 reward → **0.6:1** ❌
- **Target 2:** $155 (prior resistance) = $13.41 reward → **1.2:1** ❌
- **Target 3:** $165 (prior high) = $23.41 reward → **2.0:1** ❌

At current price with a stop at $130, the R/R to reasonable targets does NOT meet the 3:1 threshold.

### Scenario B: Pullback Entry (Preferred)
- **Entry:** $135 (pullback to breakout support + rising SMA50)
- **Stop:** $127 (3mo POC / base support) = **$8 risk**
- **Target 1:** $149 = $14 reward → **1.75:1** ❌
- **Target 2:** $165 = $30 reward → **3.75:1** ✅

A pullback to $135 with a stop at $127 targeting $165 gives **3.75:1** — this meets the Shannon threshold.

### Scenario C: Tight Stop (Aggressive)
- **Entry:** $141.59 (current)
- **Stop:** $135 (breakout level / SMA50 area) = **$6.59 risk**
- **Target:** $161+ = $19.41+ reward → **2.9:1** (borderline)
- **Target:** $165 = $23.41 reward → **3.6:1** ✅

With a tighter stop at the breakout level ($135), targeting the prior highs ($165) yields **3.6:1**. However, the tight stop increases the probability of being shaken out during normal volatility.

### R/R Verdict
The R/R is **borderline at current prices.** The ideal entry was $127–135 during the base (which has passed). From here:
- A pullback to $135–138 would create a clean 3:1+ setup with stop at $127
- Current entry works only with a tight stop at $135 and conviction to target $165
- This is NOT a "pound the table" R/R setup at $141 — it requires patience for a pullback or acceptance of tighter risk parameters

## 7. Recommendation

### VERDICT: WATCHLIST — BUY ON PULLBACK TO $135–138

**The Good:**
- Weekly Stage 2 primary uptrend intact — the wind is at your back
- Daily just transitioned to Stage 2 from a well-formed 3-month accumulation base
- MA alignment is textbook bullish on both timeframes (short > intermediate > long, all rising)
- Volume pattern is perfect: quiet base → expansion on breakout → big volume on most recent rally
- $130 has massive confluence support (VP POC + SMA200)
- RSI neutral on both timeframes — room to run
- Fundamental story is elite (AI data center networking monopoly, 65% GMs, Jayshree)

**The Concern:**
- R/R at current price ($141.59) doesn't cleanly meet the 3:1 requirement
- $149 VAH and $155–165 prior highs represent significant overhead resistance
- MACD histogram slightly negative on both timeframes
- The stock has already rallied ~$15 off the $127 low — chasing here adds risk
- The November crash from $165→$114 (-31%) shows this stock can be volatile on pullbacks

**Action Plan:**
1. **Add to active watchlist** — ANET is in the right stage, in the right sector, with the right setup developing
2. **Set alerts at $135–138** — a pullback to this zone (rising SMA20/SMA50, former resistance now support) creates the 3:1+ entry
3. **If entering at current levels ($140–142):** Use a tight stop at $135 (the breakout level) and target $165 (prior highs). This gives ~3.5:1 but with a higher probability of being stopped out
4. **Full position on confirmation:** A close above $149 (VAH) on volume would confirm the new upleg and justify a wider stop at $135 with targets at $165+
5. **Invalidation:** A close below $127 (base support / 3mo POC) would negate the Stage 2 thesis and suggest the November correction isn't over

### Position Sizing Note
Given the borderline R/R, consider a half-position at current levels with a plan to add on either:
- A pullback to $135–138 that holds (adds at better R/R)
- A breakout above $149 on volume (adds on confirmation of trend)

This allows participation in the emerging Stage 2 advance while respecting the Shannon framework's discipline on risk management.

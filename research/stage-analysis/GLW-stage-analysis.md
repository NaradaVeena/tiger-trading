# GLW (Corning Incorporated) — Multiple Timeframe Stage Analysis

**Date:** February 16, 2026
**Price:** $133.46
**Pipeline Rank:** #4 (Tiger)
**Catalyst:** Meta $6B deal, optical revenue +35% (Poorna's pick)

## 1. Current Stage Identification

### Daily Timeframe: STAGE 2 — Late Markup / Parabolic Phase

GLW is in an aggressive Stage 2 uptrend that has entered parabolic acceleration. The stock has doubled in 6 months ($65 → $133), with a catalyst-driven gap on Jan 27 ($93 → $110) on 25M shares (3x avg volume) launching the current thrust.

**Evidence:**
- Clear higher highs and higher lows from Aug through Jan
- Jan 27 breakaway gap on the Meta deal blew through all prior resistance
- Price has gained +$40 (43%) in just 3 weeks since the gap
- The "staircase" pattern is intact but steepening dangerously — this is the late-stage euphoric acceleration Shannon warns about

### Weekly Timeframe: STAGE 2 — Extended Markup

The weekly chart shows an even cleaner Stage 2 that has been running for over a year (+152%). The last 3 weekly candles are outsized green bars on massive volume (75M, 58M, 62M vs ~30M normal weekly volume). This is a stock in full institutional accumulation mode, but the velocity of the recent move signals late-stage euphoria.

**52-Week Range:** $37.31 – $136.83 (currently at 52-week high / all-time high territory)

## 2. Moving Average Alignment

### Daily MAs
| MA | Value | Slope | Position |
|----|-------|-------|----------|
| SMA5 | $131.47 | Steeply rising | Below price |
| SMA20 | $110.41 | Rising sharply | ~17% below price |
| SMA50 | $97.33 | Rising | ~27% below price |
| SMA200 | ~$85 (est.) | Rising | ~36% below price |

**Alignment:** SMA5 > SMA20 > SMA50 > SMA200 — **textbook Stage 2 bullish alignment** with all MAs rising. No ambiguity here.

### Weekly MAs
| MA | Value | Slope |
|----|-------|-------|
| SMA10 (wk) | $98.80 | Rising |
| SMA20 (wk) | $91.64 | Rising |
| SMA40 (wk) | $75.72 | Rising |

**Alignment:** Short > Intermediate > Long, all rising — **confirmed Stage 2 on weekly**.

### ⚠️ Extension Warning
Price is **35% above the daily SMA50** and **43% above the weekly SMA20**. This is an extreme extension. Shannon's framework notes that "the further a stock travels from a valid level of support, the riskier purchases are regardless of trend maturity." Greed-driven fast rallies like this "can decline faster than they rallied."

## 3. Volume Character

### Confirms the Move — Emphatically

| Period | Volume | Context |
|--------|--------|---------|
| 50-day avg | 8M/day | Baseline |
| 10-day avg | 12M/day | 50% above normal |
| Jan 27 (gap day) | 25M | 3x normal — institutional conviction |
| Jan 28 | 19M | Follow-through buying |
| Feb 6 (breakout $122) | 12M | Above average |
| Feb 9 (thrust to $131) | 16M | 2x normal |

**Pattern:** Volume expanded significantly on every up-thrust and has remained elevated for 3 weeks. This is textbook Stage 2 volume — expanding in the direction of the trend. Pullback days (Jan 28-30, Feb 4-5) saw volume contract relative to rally days.

**One Concern:** Feb 12 printed a bearish shooting star ($136.83 high → $131.50 close) on 12M volume, and Feb 13 had a wide-range reversal candle ($124.80 low → $133.46 close). High volume without further upside progress after an extended move is a distribution signal per Shannon. This bears watching.

## 4. Key Support & Resistance Levels

### Resistance
| Level | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| $136.83 | All-time high | Hit Feb 12, immediate resistance |
| $140-150 | Psychological / projection | Round numbers, no historical reference (blue sky) |

### Support (from Volume Profile & structure)
| Level | Type | Strength |
|-------|------|----------|
| $124-125 | Recent swing low (Feb 13 intraday) | Fresh, moderate |
| $110-113 | Daily SMA20 area + consolidation zone | Strong — first "real" support |
| $103-105 | Gap support (Jan 27 gap fill zone) | Very strong — gap + high volume area |
| $96.43 | 6mo VP VAH | Strong — prior resistance → support |
| $88-90 | 6mo VP POC ($88.47) + prior consolidation | Very strong — maximum volume node |
| $85.41 | Weekly VP VAH | Strong |
| $72-75 | 6mo VP VAL / Weekly SMA40 | Catastrophic support only |

### Key Levels Summary
- **Near support:** $124-125 (weak), $110 (SMA20, moderate)
- **Gap fill support:** $103-105 (strong)
- **Major support:** $88-96 zone (VP high-volume, very strong)

## 5. Multi-Timeframe Alignment

| Timeframe | Stage | Trend | MAs | Volume | Verdict |
|-----------|-------|-------|-----|--------|---------|
| Weekly | Stage 2 | Strong uptrend | All bullish, rising | Expanding on rallies | ✅ Bullish |
| Daily | Stage 2 (late) | Parabolic acceleration | All bullish, rising | Expanding but exhaustion signs | ⚠️ Bullish but extended |

**Alignment:** Both timeframes are in confirmed Stage 2 with aligned MAs. This is the highest-probability configuration per Shannon's framework. **However**, the degree of extension from MAs on both timeframes creates elevated risk for new entries.

**RSI Confirmation:**
- Daily RSI: 76.6 (overbought)
- Weekly RSI: 85.6 (extremely overbought)

Both timeframes are overbought simultaneously, which typically precedes a correction or at minimum a consolidation pause.

## 7. Recommendation

### 🟡 WAIT FOR PULLBACK — Do Not Chase

**The trend is unambiguously bullish.** Both timeframes confirm Stage 2 with full MA alignment and volume confirmation. The Meta $6B deal is a legitimate fundamental catalyst that institutional money is positioning around. This stock *should* go higher over the intermediate term.

**But the entry is wrong at $133.** Shannon's framework is explicit: "the further a stock has traveled from a valid level of support, the riskier purchases are." GLW is 35% above its 50-day SMA and 43% above its weekly 20-SMA. RSI is overbought on both timeframes. The Feb 12-13 candles show the first signs of supply entering (shooting star reversal at $136.83).

**Action Plan:**

1. **Primary plan: Buy the first higher low on a pullback to $108-115.** This would bring price back toward the rising SMA20 and the upper consolidation zone. Look for a 2-3 day pullback on declining volume, then enter on the first higher high on the daily timeframe. Stop below $103 (gap support). Target $137-150. R:R of 3:1+.

2. **Aggressive plan: If it consolidates sideways at $125-135 for 1-2 weeks** and the SMA20 catches up, a breakout above $137 with volume could be bought. The time correction would create a more favorable entry.

3. **If gap fills to $103-105:** Very attractive entry. This would be the "broken stairstep" correction Shannon describes as bullish and necessary. Buy the first higher high after the gap test. Stop below $96. Target $133+. R:R of 3:1+.

4. **Avoid below $96 (VP VAH).** A break below this level would suggest the Meta gap was a "blow-off" event and the stock needs more time to digest. Stage could shift to Stage 3 distribution.

### Key Levels to Monitor
- **Upside trigger:** Break and close above $137 on volume = new leg higher
- **Healthy pullback zone:** $108-115 (SMA20 + consolidation)
- **Danger zone:** Below $103 (gap fill) on heavy volume = reassess
- **Invalidation:** Below $96 = thesis broken

### Bottom Line for Tiger
GLW is a strong Stage 2 stock with a legitimate catalyst. It deserves its #4 pipeline ranking. But **timing matters** — entering a parabolic move at all-time highs with overbought RSI on both timeframes violates the framework's risk management principles. Patience here is the edge. The pullback will come (it always does in Stage 2), and when it does, GLW should be bought aggressively.
